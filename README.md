# Text_Generation_EleutherAI_GPT-Neo1.3Bmodel

# Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B model for creative text generation.
The script preprocesses user-provided prompts, cleans them, and generates coherent and engaging stories.
It's designed to showcase the potential of advanced natural language processing techniques for storytelling, content creation, and language model experimentation.

# Features
# Preprocessing: 
Text cleaning and sentence tokenization for optimal input.
# Customizable Text Generation: 
Control parameters like max_length, temperature, top_k, and top_p.
# Seamless Integration:
Uses the Hugging Face transformers library for streamlined functionality.

# Requirements
Python 3.8+
# transformers library
nltk library

Install dependencies with:
pip install transformers nltk

# Usage
# Preprocess Input:
Clean and tokenize your text with the preprocess_text function.

# Generate Text:
Pass a prompt to the generate_story function to create a story. 

# Example:
prompt = "In a distant galaxy, a brave warrior"
story = generate_story(prompt)
print(story)

# Adjust Parameters:
Modify parameters like max_length or temperature to customize the output.

# Applications
Creative text generation
Content generation for blogs or social media
Experimenting with natural language models
