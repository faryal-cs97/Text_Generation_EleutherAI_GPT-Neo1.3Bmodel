0,"<s>[INST] The open blue sky provided the people of the Guardian nation with a beautiful day. There wasn't a sign of a cloud in the sky and the signs of demons in the area were decreasing day by day. Since the light showered the ground with its beautiful and elegant radiance that spread throughout the area it blessed with its warmth, no demon has yet since shown its face in the Guardian capital area. Toward one of the garrisons peaking over the city outward, a girl can be seen sightseeing on one of the balconies that peered high up into the sky several stories. The beautiful pink haired girl dressed in mostly red and black leaned on the wooden railing as she looked out at the city below her. Standing beside her was a mysterious woman dressed mostly in black with most of her appearance concealed and toward her left was her bestfriend she knew since the academy. They once were rivals, but ever since they really got to know each other and see eye for eye they've become true friends.
Meira gave off a deep sigh making it known that she looked bored. There wasn't really much to do and all she could do at the moment was sight-see over the magnificent Guardian capital known as Ereis Eisan. The city and the castle of the naton were divided by a Dragonmire Mountain and the only way to reach the castle was either to take the treacherous mountain-path or take one of the trolleys that lifted you skyward over the city toward the top of the mountain then downward toward the recreation area where you would have to register before given admittance to the castle. The woman that continued just to stare at the sky didn't say a word and Ranathia was busy studying one of her tomes she bought from one of the magic shops in the city. Airships continued to soar over the gigantic Guardian capital as Meira continued to peer over the city watching the man sights she could perceive.
When she was about to enter the garrison, a soldier approached her with a request that the king asked her to the castle. Meira looked at Ranathia who just asked her right after the soldier talked to her what he wanted where she said toward her in a plain voice, ""Oh, it's just that King Razhard wants to see me."" Meira said with a deep sight not understanding why the king wouldn't get it through his head that she just didn't particular find him a person that she was interested in. At best, [/INST] he was a great friend to her, but she couldn't ever love someone that she just couldn't get herself to like in the way he wanted. That's what she thought anyway as she left the balcony then took the stairs down toward the bottom of the city where a royal airship awaited her to board it.
Like usual, the mysterious woman followed the two. Meira wanted to know why this person was stalking them and who she was, but she knew she'd just start talking nonsense and that it would be just a waste of time. She took her seat toward the front of the airship and then peaked out the window as the attendant closed the door and announced that it was leaving toward the castle. ""I wonder what he wants now?"" Meira said as she watched the airship pass over the city while she could enjoy the views from above. It has been awhile since she had taken a ride on an airship. Ever since Windgrace when she first graduated anyway. She would have used her mount to reach the castle, but the king was gracious enough to provide them with transport. One of the soldiers approached the mysterious woman and asked demanding an answer, ""Hey, what do you think you're doing?""
""What's it look like I'm doing? I'm going to accompany these two birds. Now go away."" She said irritated as she turned her face away and again put it back into the mysterious tome she was reading from. The woman didn't show any signs of responding where the soldier reached out to grab her hand causing the woman placed her hand on her blade. Meira immediately interrupted and told him that she was a guest and was a part of their unit. The soldier nodded and let them carry on with what they were doing.
It wasn't long before the ship reached its destination where it touched down and Meira and the others departed for the ship and looked at the scenic view the castle had to offer. It was a view that astounded the mysterious woman who just closely examined the area before she saw the two walking down the white stone walkway toward the castle that stretched into the sky. When they started to approach the entrance they heard someone causing a ruckus and looked like there was a problem. Meira approached the situation to see what was going on at the entrance and she was very surprised by her view. It looked like two individuals were having a disagreement, but she wasn't close enough to hear what it was about. </s>"
1,"<s>[INST] Meira overheard some of the words in the argument where her mood finally changed. She didn't look to pleased when she approached the scene along with the two other people that were accompanying her. Ranathia also had a frown on her face, but the other mysterious woman didn't look like she cared at all. The words she heard when she approached the soldier that was arguing with Nathan were ""whore"" and the second was ""virgin"". Both words annoyed her when she thought about them thoroughly. She stopped a few feet away from the two where she went, ""Ahem..."" Tapping her foot down on the ground in disgust and then crossing her arms with a cold stare in her eyes letting everyone around know that she was upset.
Instead of approaching the soldier first, she turned her attention directly toward Nathan where she responded as the soldier took a bow then apologized to her for what he had said when he realized who her commanding officer was, ""As much as I appreciate you standing up for my honor, Nathan. I'm pretty sure you could have just stayed quiet and found me instead of instigate a confrontation over here."" She bent down with her hands on her hips with the same cold stare in her eyes where she then continued once again, ""How do you know I'm a virgin? I'm certainly not a whore, but what gives you the right to speak for my modesty? You not only misrepresented Windgrace when doing that, but you also are guilty of insubordination."" She paused for a moment as she pulled herself away from Nathan again returning to her normal stance as she paced about him where she continued on, ""I'm not saying I don't appreciate what you did; moreover, the fact you need to know when to just let things go and bury the hatchet sometimes too.""
""Forgive me, Lady Meira. I had no idea you were his commanding officer. I sincerely apologize for my insults [/INST] and I will accept any punishment you deem fit for someone like me."" The first soldier said scared as the second one was so frightened that he couldn't even open his mouth.
""That will be unnecessary. You are not one of my soldiers so I cannot punish you though I will speak about your behavior toward the King himself."" She boldly stated as the soldier gave off an oh man kind of gesture keeping his mouth shut while Meira turned her attention toward Nathan. ""With that all aside, we'll go ahead and pass."" Meira explained toward the guards as they stepped aside and allowed the people to enter. The woman who followed Meira took a brief glance at Nathan then looked away quickly with a silent sigh saying quietly, ""Why would a divine race want to impersonate... No... nevermind..."" She shook her head softly becoming silent once again.
Ranathia turned her eyes toward Meira as she saw the woman that followed them look toward Nathan asking her as they passed through the archway large downs that opened for them as they step inside the large structure. ""Has she been always following us?""
""Yeah, but anyway..."" Meira answered as she turned her attention toward Nathan. She looked at him then winked toward him, ""Been awhile hasn't it? Already made it up to second in command of my unit, huh?"" She praised him before she continued with what she said, ""I'm surprised to find another person from the Windgracian Academy here like myself. You should remember me since I am of the Rystaliuskal family line and was one of the nobles attending the academy. The status was rather irritating though. Must have sucked for you how they treated you in the academy giving you a room separate from my own. I sometimes think the nobles here are complete idiots."" Meira said as Ranathia and the woman said nothing as they walked down the hallway in the castle. </s>"
2,"<s>[INST] A lady in a red robe walked behind Meria and Nathan, and interrupted, ""I would believe it is Rystaliuskal, would that be correct Meria. Sorry for interrupting but I would just like to introduce myself. I am Aira Evene of Xi. You probably haven't heard of Xi, it is a small island of nothing but trade and herbs."" Aira gave Nathan a strange look, and then quickly looked away. ""I am acting as a medical a [/INST] dviser to the king and his army. I don't know much about swords and shields, but I am fine alchemist and doctor. The herbs of Xi have served me well, and I plan to use them to give Guardia exactly what it deserves. ""she paused and continued, ""Victory over their enemies."" she said, a bit boastfully. Aira shifted her eyes from person to person, and then quickly left each one in turn moving to the next. </s>"
3,"<s>[INST] Aira felt her skin crawl every time the word ""holy"" was used, but she tried to hide it the best she could, which was really good. ""What a lovely story Meira, and I am sorry for mispronouncing your name. It is probably my islander accent."" she said smiling warmly. ""And nice to meet you too Rana. I am sorry for not noticing you. Work has been busy, I been having to keep on my alchemy lab, and try to find ways to improve the efficiency of the Guardian's medicine and i [/INST] t has been a challenge. My I be bold enough to ask what brings you here?"" she asked.
Aira noticed how Nathan was starting to feel uncomfortable, ""Nathan, is it, if you need to take your mind off things, I could show you around my basic alchemy lab, presuming you would like and your commanding officers don't mind. It can be quite a sight for people who haven't seen one before. I need to poke my head in there anyways pretty soon, and I can always enjoy some company."" </s>"
4,"<s>[INST] Wonderful' Aira replied, as she walked towards her alchemy lab. She reached into her robes and grabbed a key and unlocked her lab and relocked it from the inside behind them. Sorry for having to lock the door, I just can't have people stumbling in and knocking something over or something. It is quite easy to mistake one room for another in a castle this big."" she said.
The room was covered in shelves and shelves of diff [/INST] erent veils which held many different multicolored liquids. Each one having a small label saying something to the like of ""Pt56, or Ps103."" and many different things. In the center of a room, there was a large cauldron with a small metallic box with fire wood in it.
Aira shuffled over to a desk and started to sort some of the papers that were thrown about it. ""So, how do you feel about the nobles of Guardia's mainlands."" </s>"
5,"<s>[INST] Oh, and where are my manners. Would you like something to drink? Aira asked, as she poured him a cup of tea and offered it to him. ""My I just warn you, corrupt runs deep in Guardia, but lucky, King Razhard is working on it."" she said, smiling. ""Though, may I ask, how much do you know a [/INST] bout mana and Xi? And do you mind if I waste a bit more of your time with a little story. Xi isn't in the best of shapes right now, and Guardia's hands are full with other conflicts, which is way I am here to help end those conflicts so Xi can be restored to its former glory."" she said. </s>"
6,"<s>[INST] I think you may be mistaking ellan for pure mana. It is a common mistake, there is really one difference and that is pure mana doesn't use esir or ragna like other magics. Many people are either indifferent or even hateful towards it. I think you might recognize more it as archant, which is magic using mana. However, to Xi, mana is much more important. XI grows lots of manawyn which is a common ingredient used to create pure mana.. Manawyn was once a very important export of Xi and mana has been long apart of our tradition.
""However, recently Archant has been banned in Xi. It has become illegal to grow or sell manawyn hurting our economy and putting many of the lowe [/INST] r class Xians out of work. Many of the noble families brushed this off so the revolts are being put down, mostly because the nobles get all of their money from trade. It is because of the greedy Guardia nobles. You see, Xi is controlled by the Guardia King and the greedy nobles of Guardia used this to push for an Archant ban. Guarida didn't buy any manawyn, so by banning it, they both hurt are pride and our economy without even affecting Guardia."" she paused, and continued, "" I am sorry for the rant, but I just needed to let someone know how I been feeling.""
""And you haven't drank any of your tea yet. Please, drink up. I might get offend if you don't."" she continued. </s>"
7,"<s>[INST] A wave of enchantment immediately flowed though Nathan as he drunk the tea. ""Now, don't worry."" Aira said, knowing that he would feel it. ""You see, there is a possible traitor running around this class, and I simply slipped you a truth potion. I just need to know if your a hiding a [/INST] nything from me. You can say quite, but your silence might just prove your guiltiness, so I repeat, are you trying to hide anything."" she said, with a sly smile. She knew that he probably wasn't a traitor, but knew that everyone was hiding something and the more she knew the better. </s>"
8,"<s>[INST] Aira laughed in her head, thinking ""I have never heard of someone who was ""pretty sure"" they wasn't a traitor, but I should keep a straight face, I shouldn't reveal my own intentions yet."" Aira straighten up, ""So, Nathan, you are probably not the ""traitor"", then tell me, who exactly are you."" she said out loud and then went back to her thoughts, ""S [/INST] o this boy does hold some secrets, I should use the guise of protecting the throne to dig up some more dirt on him. He was with Meira, so he must be someone of importance, having something on the ""holy knights"" blood could serve the cult well, and Nathan was the weakest link. I also did hear something about Nathan muttered from one of those girls."" </s>"
9,"<s>[INST] By the sounds of it, you are dragonite, I am only guessing but your word choice is quite clear. But in Xi you should know that dragonites are respected. It is said that dragonites gained there incredible power though the use of mana, which my people holds dear. Persecution of dragons is sill [/INST] y, people simply fear what is beyond them. If you seek to run from the truth, I may give the antidote and we may go separate ways, but otherwise, you do keep good company. And there is a legend on the island that dragonites can be good luck. he said, smiling, and pulling out a veil of liquid. </s>"
10,"<s>[INST] Now that those two are gone, why do we go someplace we can talk? The woman said when she saw both Aira and Nathan were out of sight. What she was about to talk about had nothing to do with those two. Well, the most important segments didn't anyway. Meira and Ranathia both were hesitant about following the woman where Meira asked her once again the same question Ranathia did, but this time only inquired for her name, ""I feel strange not knowing a person by their name. At least allow us both the liberty of knowing your name. I know it's a lot to ask for, but I'm sure it's something little compared what so much you have to acknowledge.""
""Siia."" The woman paused for a moment as she pulled down her hood to reveal her face toward the two girls. She then started to walk in the direction of a room which she looked like she wanted to visit. The two followed her without question where she added to what she said, ""My name is Siianthaliae Vanb'Rianthei. Back in elder times I went by various nicknames though the one mortals know me by the most is Thali Aventhosai."" She paused for a moment as Meira and Ranathia were both surprised to see what this woman actually looked like. Neither of them imagined such a cold approaching beautiful raven haired woman underneath that cl [/INST] oak. Though near some of the ends of hair were shards of a silvery glistening shine on her hair which was awkward. Neither have met anyone who had two different hair colorings even if it was hard to visualize.
She lead the two into a room asking the guard to make sure no one interrupted their conversation where he just nodded at the two and allowed them to enter. The room had an array of chairs where Siia walked over and took a seat in one of them. She pulled her hood back over head when she took a seat then asked the other two to take a seat as well. Ranathia and Meira both took a seat in the two chairs that were arrayed across from the one that Siia was sitting in.She then looked at the two having a few questions to ask before she was going to begin what she was about to say, ""Now that it is just the three of us, I have a few questions to ask upon you two Elian descendant youths before I begin with what I have to tell you.""
Both girls answered with, ""Okay."" They weren't sure what Siia had to say, but if she just started talking then it was always something very important. They noticed that she always talked with it was completely relevant. They both were going to listen to everything she had to say and answer the questions she had for them if they could. </s>"
11,"<s>[INST] One of the soldiers saw Nathan wandering the castle where he approached and informed that Meira and Ranathia accompanied a mysterious woman toward one of the guest rooms. He told him to follow him and he'd regroup him with the girls.
""You probably know by now that six continents make up the world of Gaea, but you don't know is all those continents at time were part of an enormous landmass called Elia. Elia was the large continent that the Avernia Empire used to rule over where Xhosa was at the helm of it all. He ruled almost the entire Elian continent meaning the entire world except a strip of land known as Ehtolia. Ehtolia is located on the southern tip of the Holyoke continent. Ehtolia is still owned by no nation. The land is protected by a sandstorm that prevents outsiders from entering it. Anyway, Ehtolia is where the deities decided to descend upon man and aid them in the fight against the tyranny of the Harken and its ruler Xhosa. The deities temporarily took refuge in the land of Ehtolia known to many as the Blessed Promised Land. These deities gave birth to children who would later become Elian Crusaders. When it looked like the Avernian Army had defeated all of its adversaries and only the Phaedrians were the ones still with the power to put up a fight, that is when several men and women rose up and brandished ancient weapons that were crafted by the deities and give to their holy blood or children to use. There was Saint Idris Guardia who is the son of Emerlink. He wielded the Spear of Salvation known as Daesleurph. The next was Angelian Elyria Eden who founded the Kingdom of Eden. She wielded the powerful Tome of Apostles known as the Ephemeris Luminaire. She bared the holy blood of Eternia Goddess of Miracle.
Then there was the Hero of Chaos Flambard Cimmeria who brandished the Shattering Horizon Halberd Catastrophia blessed by the God of Power Arcturus. He was an Arkadian who migrated from another world to Gaea like quite a few of the other Elian Crusaders. The Holy Knight of Elia known as Aurelian Zeustzius who brandished the Blade of Light otherwise known as the famous Holy Sword Meleitling. Aurelian's holy blood was that of the Goddess of Mortal Universe Destruction Euphoria. The sword had another form which you will learn about in time. A Dragonite Elian by the name of Mehetabel Ereseal brandished the Magic Destroying Wing Blade known as Ragnadaim. It is sometimes nicknamed the Gemini Blade. He bared the holy blood of Agnevastra Goddess of Alteration. Loshan Lumina was an Angelian who formed the Kingdom of Lumina. He wielded another powerful magic tome called Rias Provaine or the Tome of the Divine Flame. Sometimes known as the Book of the Sacred Flame. He bared the holy blood of Xaliana Goddess of Connection.
Azrael of the Four Winds formed the Sacred Dragonia Dynasty who was also a Dragonite like his brother Flambard. Azrael Dragonia wielded the El Gladius Kaze or the Sword of Wind. He was the holy blood of Fujin who is the Goddess of the Wind. The next two Elian Crusaders were a pair of sisters by the name of Thali and Myra Aventhosai. Thali was the holy blood of Stellvia the Goddess of Space-Time and Myra was the holy blood of Xiashakue the Goddess of Truth. Thali brandished the Sword of the Seventh Seal Broniac also known as the Emblem of Apocalypse and her sister used the Orbs of Elan Gossamer Facula which means The Eternal Truth. Another of the ancient weapons created was the one Stralia blessed known as the Berserker Band or now known as Mistaleyn. Stralia is the Goddess of Adversity and the person who wielded that weapon was Abimelech Levantaike who later formed the United Emirates of Avarona. He was a famous Nekrian who looked a lot like a wolverine. The one who wielded the Scepter of Elysia Elaire Vastral was a man by the name of Galdaris Danasta. His holy blood was Evangelina the Goddess of Mortal Universe Creation. He was the opposite of Aurelian. The two holy weapons Meleitling and Elaire Vastral were considered to be two of the most powerful only second to the almighty Broniac. The holy blood of the God of Destiny Altair was an Arkadian man by the name of Reishin Primavalthera. He wielded the holy weapon known as Ewigeskyn otherwise known as the Spear of the Blessed Eternals.
The next weapon was a rune which was extremely dangerous and only those with enough wisdom could ever control it. It was known [/INST] as the Sacria Versya Tristania Vashuna wielded that chaotic weapon of destruction which was the holy blood of the God of Eternal Decay Kreosus. It is said that only Rudorians could wield the Sacria Versya and the Vashuna family were a group of Rudorians who lived in Xiria. The next of the holy blood was a man named Lucent'phelias Xanathare who wielded the Sword of Elan the famous Vale Loess who was the holy blood of Elan Goddess of Magic. Another that bared holy blood which was a famous alchemist by the name of Luciferias Atharva. He was a Mahzok and the original founder of the magic known as Atharva. He was the holy blood of the God of Wisdom Thraanphal and wielded the Scythe of Nightmares Ebona Orifice. Another famous alchemist from the Nedre race known as Erasmus Vanslandaiya was the holy blood of the God of Judgment Pleiadeis who wielded the Tome of Mystics Phantasa Magorias who eventually formed the Kingdom of Larciena. Vermilia Axthrusia also known as the Saint's Sword of Virtue is the holy blood of Virtue with her sword Chrysoareis. Avantasia Rosenau was the holy blood of Lumina the Goddess of Commandment who wielded the Spear of Suzerain Fafnir. Ambrose Xandria who was the holy blood of Sateria the God of War wielded the Hammer of War Thoralis. Halfenaijuen Xeivanthestra bared the holy blood of Illusia Goddess of Enchantment and wielded the Sword of Illusions Nyghtmaer.
The two Phaedrians Magdalene Zorathan and Atroshaniu Rev'athalena famous in human religions also bared two holy weapons. Atroshaniu bared the Sword of Light Langrisser while Magdalene bared the Sword of Darkness Alhazard. Atroshaniu's holy blood was Hemera whereas Magdalene's was Nyx. Dimensia the Eternal Spear of Chaos was wielded by the holy blood of the Goddess of Chaos Millicent Alutemu Siebenthal. The Primordial Sword of Avalon known as the Sword of Absolute Power Asture Promusa was wielded by Savraj Zamora. He was the holy blood of the almighty Goddess of All-Creation Sigma. It is often that sword is called the Sword of Sigma or The All Destroyer Sword. The last time the Elian Crusaders appeared was the last time that sword has ever been seen. It has other nicknames such as The All Gathering Sword of Eternal Power. Reynburne Leibrandt wielded the Sky Sword Arcadia. He was the Elian Crusader of the Goddess of the Sky Andromeda. The Sword of Quintessence Celesna was wielded by Desiserius Zarcarias who was the holy blood of the mysterious goddess Aira known as the Goddess of the Reverse World. The next was the Windwaker Bow Ichivail blessed by the Goddess of Vision Lacyndora. It was wielded by a famous elf by the name of Deusdedit Etroshalt who bared Lacyndora's holy blood. The next Elian Crusader wielded the Staff of Revelation Caledonia his name was Dhihlat Lavarose who was the holy blood of the God of Revelation. The Scepter of Death Dethmaire was wielded by the Elian Crusader Xanthus Auslander.
The Sword of Inferos Einsatz was wielded the Elian Crusader Einlanzer Fallsmyeriche who was the holy blood of the God of the Infernos Agni. The Elian Crusader that wields the famous Serpentine Thunder Blade Levatein was Sergius Glasford the holy blood of Indra the Goddess of Electricity. The Elian Crusader who wielded the Aquamarine Rod of Water was a priestess girl by the name of Fiona Ingrassia. She was the holy blood of the Goddess of Aqua and surprisingly she was a Mathua. These thirty Elian Crusaders blessed with holy weapons rose up against Xhosa and used their powers granted to them to destroy Xhosa. After Xhosa's defeat, six of them formed the six most powerful nations at that time. The others formed smaller nations, become wanders or drifters or served the other rulers."" Was the last of Siia's words as she took a while to pause from a long winded explanation. She didn't expect it to take her that long to explain how many Elian Crusaders existed, but they probably didn't know there were thirty of them. Not all the gods and goddesses were accounted for. Just the ones that took part in the Ehtolian Miracle.
""WOW!"" Meira exclaimed when she heard about how many Elian Crusaders there were. She was surprised that there was so many. If that many holy weapons existed then that means there were a lot of weapons out there unaccounted for. Meira had no idea that so many holy weapons existed on Gaea. It was absolutely amazing to think that many actually were created. </s>"
12,"<s>[INST] Both sides of your parents were affiliated with holy blood. It just really depends on which divine blood is stronger in your body which is what decides if you have major holy blood or not. If there is the precedence of more than 50% of one blood type of holy blood in your body then you major in that holy blood and may brandish your progenitor's holy weapon. Siia added knowing the girls would want to know how you could tell if they holy blood or not. While she gave them that explanation she shifted in her chair the position her body was sitting then peered over by large white door colored mostly in white. A large red and golden embroidery carpet lead straight for the door and the chairs were craftsmanship work as you could see all the beautiful designs on the would that was well carved. She knew someone was at the door so that is when she started to go quiet.
Meira and Ranathia both asked why she had just stopped talking. She hadn't really told them everything to make it more clear of what they heard from her. All they knew about were there were thirty Elian Crusaders which carried holy weapons. Other than that aside from the ones that represented nations later in their lives, they knew little about these people. There were familiar names they heard from the woman such as Aurelian, Lucent, Reishin, Magdalene, and lasty Atroshaniu. They remember Erialyss telling them about the Phaedrian Elians Magdalene and Atroshaniu, but Erialyss didn't know exactly how they were born. She suggests a logical reason that they were born after the Phaedrians used their knowledge of Holy Magic while maintaining a heavy defense at Ehtolia which eventually they heard their calls and started to descend onto the planet known as Gaea. She says that she was told that her parents were born from two divine entities.She believes the dishonorable entity known as Nyx mated with Hemera at Hemera's suggestion which gave birth to her mother and father. Her mother was mainly Nyx holy blood whereas her father was blessed by Hemera. Even though they believed what Erialyss said, everything she has said about her parents is completely unsupported, but it provides for a truth to their birth which is a distinct possibility.
Both girls were still heavily wrapped in thoughts about what they heard from Lady Siia. They were even more curious how she knew all this about the Elian Crusaders moreover how she knew about what looked like every holy weapon in existence. The woman was very mysterious where she covered most of her entire appearance with the black cloak she wore over her entire body. The clothes underneath her body they saw faintly didn't look like clothes of any civilization so far that had established itself on Gaea. They were shiny and made from an usual fabric. This just made the two more curious about who Siia really was. They didn't know her age, origin and in fact they knew hardly anything about this woman.
One thing that really bothered Ranathia which she tried to hide was the fact when she saw what that woman looked like. She resembled her so closely and she wanted to know why that was? Thoughts revolved around in her mind as she closely examined the woman who still was at silence not talking at all again. Why does this woman look like me? Other than an age difference, she looks really no different than me. That hair tone looks exactly like mine and those light blue eyes she has... This just feels so strange and makes me wonder if I have any relation at all to this woman. I mean, unlike most people I never knew anything about my parents. I know I had two brothers and a sister who was murdered, but even if they weren't brothers or sister by blood I still considered them my brothers and sister. I also know that Ranathia isn't my actual name. My mother and father gave me a name, but I don't remember what it was. In fact, I don' [/INST] t remember either of them or their faces. This just doesn't make any sense at all... Ranathia thought as a frustrated look overtook her face where Meira asked if she was okay. She just nodded at Meira trying to retain her composure.
""Ma'am?"" A voice called out as the white door off to the side of the girl's opened where a guard cladded in black and white armored waltz in. He looked over Siia's direction and apologized for his interruption. She shook her head then just asked him, ""What is it? There is no reason to feel uneasy around me. Just tell me what is on your mind."" Siia said as she turned her attention toward the guard. She was upset at all by the guard's sudden interruption. No one was talking anyway and she didn't want to tell these girls more with people in the area which she didn't hardly know about. She closed her eyes for a moment and sensed the aura in the region and noticed the Dragonite child had come back. ""So the hopeless one is back?"" Pausing temporarily she lowered her voice a bit, ""That Dragonite is sometimes an eyesore."" She questioned as she had just sensed Nathan's aura in the air. The guard didn't understand what she meant by hopeless one or Dragonite thinking that it was just a joke, but the young boy that was with them earlier was back if that's what she meant.
""Also the King is ready for his audience with you."" The soldier added as he kept the door cracked. He didn't want to impose on the woman who he thought looked very scary. Just her aura sent chills down his spine. He didn't think something so vicious looking would be completely harmless, but that didn't stop him from keeping his awareness up just in case it was a trick. ""I suppose we shall get going then."" Siia announced as she stood up from her chair and made her way toward the door. She stopped for a moment in place as Meira and Ranathia talked to each other collecting her thoughts from before the time she came into the room. Cautiously thinking toward herself, that woman we met earlier cannot be trusted. I'll remain a sentinel toward these girls and as long as I wield Broniac I'll always be able to protect them. Those two girls have the potential to destroy Avernus once and for all. Both are opposites that have become friends which in turn has strengthen their bonds and the holy blood that flows through their veins. I guess the New Children as the revelation revealed will lead the new era. I do know that this will be the final time my brother interferes with the course this world is going down. His influence over the world has been contagious and its his fault that Avernus is here in the first place. I have to remember to keep my guard up. He could be anywhere posing as anyone in this world. Even a mere peon could be my brother.
""Lady Siia, are you all right?"" Meira and Ranathia asked as they saw the woman looked ill a moment ago, but she nodded explaining that she was fine and she was just deep in thought. She appreciated the two girls concern where she ordered the guard to open the door so they could step back into the hallway. When they reentered the hallway, various picture frames and ornaments adorned the hallway in elegant beauty. The roses that hanged toward the part of the wall the torches came out of kissed the wall caressing the side of the wall laying in silence unwavering. The pictures that hung on the wall told a lot about the history of the Guardia nation. Some were pictures of the inside of the castle, some were of a another castle, others were of the town or the royal family that was part of the Guardia lineage. When the three were back in he hallway they noticed a brunette haired boy approaching their direction who was dressed in armor. They knew it was Nathan where Meira and Ranathia questioned toward him, ""What's wrong, Nathan? What is the rush in finding us? Didn't you enjoy your little tour?"" </s>"
13,"<s>[INST] Nathan breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Meira and Ranathia unharmed ""oh thank god you two are okay. Listen, I know this might sound odd, but did that strange women do anything to you? Like maybe drug you?""
Meira was confused by the question Nathan just asked her and Ranathia didn't know what to think about it other than perhaps Nathan had been overwhelmed by taking a look at her lab and it was going to his head. Meira began by asking Nathan when she was completely confused, ""Nathan, what do you mean by that?"" She paused for a moment thinking about the drugging part which was even harder to understand why he would ask such a question where Ranathia answered for her, ""No, that woman we just met didn't do anything to us. If she did, the grumpy woman over there."" She paused temporarily taking her finger and pointing in briefly at Siia, ""Would have known by now. I don't know what has gotten into you, but it looks like you've been under quite a spell of things.""
""We're fine, Nathan."" Meira added when Ranathia went silent. She looked over toward Siia, but she didn't say anything. Though her finger was underneath her chin which [/INST] gave the impression she was thinking about something.
Nathan continued, ""I only ask because that women who showed me her lab did that to me and I wasn't sure if there was some sort of plot to split us up before attacking. She claims she's here to find some kind of traitor, but I don't buy that. She made it quite clear that she has no love for Guardia, and in fact might even benefit from it's fall. So it wouldn't surprise me if she was really here with far more sinister goals in mind.""
""Take this."" The woman said toward Nathan as she threw him something she pulled out of her cloak. ""It's a Neutralizer I made with my divine energy. Since it's pure holy power you may want to soak yourself with this."" She added as she threw him another bottle which contained some holy water in it. ""That's high grade Erufin Holy Water so do not waste it. It's hard to come-by and is very rare Just sprinkle your body with it then take that Neutralizer which will purify your body of any unwanted contagions that entered your body unexpectedly. Then come find me later and tell me exactly what that woman told you. I'll let you know after the summoning."" </s>"
14,"<s>[INST] The woman didn't say a word as she asked the guards to show them to the throne room. They passed through several hallways and flight of stairs before reaching the hallway. Meira and Ranathia were both beginning to think that going to the throne room was quite a chore in itself. Why was it so far up? Neither of them could answer that question before the guard said toward the girls, ""This way please."" He motioned toward them as he opened the large doors that revealed the throne room. The Guardia throne room was littered with all kinds of beauty. From glass painted windows that foretold its legacy all the way to picture frames and arrays of flowers and bouquets that rest on the wall. The three lady entered the room and walked across the blood red carpet that lead itself all the way up a few flight of stairs toward the where the king sat.
Razhard started to speak toward the three as they approached the throne. He was pleased the two fine ladies could find their way easily toward his throne room and was very pleased them to meet them. He started his speech with, ""Greetings ladies, I'm pleased that I can be at your acquaintance. I am King Razhard Guardia who rules over the Guardia Kingdom in my father's stead. But I'm sure you didn't come here to listen to me chat so I'll get right down to business. But first, he turned his eyes toward Eurasia who was again dressed inappropriately for the audience, ""Not again, Eurasia! We have guests and you wear that distasteful wardrobe?""
Poor Princess Alicia could only grimace at what Alicia was wearing where she frowned and crossed her arms, ""I'll wear what I want. I don't ever remember putting you in charge of my closet."" She retorted in anger as she stood there seeming to like the outfit she chose. ""Besides, the design is royalty."" Razhard could only facepalm himself for a second where Alicia told him it was a waste of time to argue with Eurasia.
""Forgi [/INST] ve me, I eluded myself from the point."" He added as he turned his attention back toward the three ladies in front him.
Before he could continue the woman stepped forward then announced herself toward Razhard. His guards wanted to react to her impudence, but he gestured to them not to interfere. ""King Razhard, from this day forward you will appoint me as your new strategist."" Those were the first words that escaped the woman's mouth. Razhard couldn't believe what he had just heard and was even more confused as to why she would just want to force him to make her his strategist. He didn't even know who this woman was and the fact she covered her appearance didn't help. He stuttered on his words when he spoke toward her while his two sisters weren't happy that she just rudely interrupted him like that. ""I don't.... even... know who you are?"" He questioned as he almost choked on his words still shocked that she would suggest such a thing. Princess Alicia stood in front of Razhard and spoke toward the woman in anger, ""How dare you just be so forceful with your words? Have you no refinement!"" The woman turned her head away barely letting her eyes see her ranting, ""What's it to you, little girl?"" Alicia was upset about being called a little girl, but she didn't waste her breath on the woman when Razhard told her just not to argue with her. Meira and Ranathia were both shocked by what they had just heard and were at a loss of words as well.
""How do we not know you're an assassin hired by another nation that is trying to get close to the king? Look at the way you're dressed. Certainly someone would have come to that conclusion or the entire guard in this castle is a bunch of morons."" A voice said as a man dressed completely in black armor walked right into the room.
""Perhaps these two girls were sent as accomplices?"" He added as he approached the king still completely dressed in heavy black armor. </s>"
15,"<s>[INST] Aira simply smiled at the confusion in the room, and weighing her options. She was off to the side, and just carefully watching the events unfold before her. One of her many options was to simple reveal Nathan as a dragonite right there. In the panic, either she or the dragon whelp would kill King Razhard. The cult was very accepting [/INST] of flexible plans, and killing Razhard and possibly a few princesses would outweigh the other possible plans, but would be a major set back if she acted against Guardia and failed. It wouldn't be the greatest lost, and the panic would damage Guardia, but it might be to risky as off now. She would watch for her time to strike if any. </s>"
16,"<s>[INST] Corraidhìn stood in the shadows on a balcony overlooking King Razhard's throne room. He had just barely been able to sneak this far into his palace, causing the deaths of several guards in the process. Unfortunately, the building was like a labyrinth. He had gotten lost numerous times as he searched for the room with the documents he needed inside. He needed to know when the best time to strike Windgrace, and the only way to know for sure would be to when Windgrace would be most vulnerable, and who would no such a thing better than King [/INST] Razhard himself. He had accidentally wandered into the throne room. Definitely not where he wanted to be. He would have made his way out as quickly as possible, but he saw something odd happening in the room. He spotted three women and a man, all weapons drawn toward one man dressed black as night, an evil grin on his face. Suddenly, an awful, impossible, idea swept across him. Suddenly he drew his mace, and flicked open his magic book with his other hand. He leaped down from the balcony and landed facing the man in black, ready to fight. </s>"
17,"<s>[INST] As Corraidhìn stood awkwardly in the crowd of people he realized what a grave error he had made. This was no mere assassination that he had dropped in on. He had hoped that the man in black was a humble assassin that he could eliminate and possibly gain the king's trust, but he was obviously more important than that. Two more people, and the guards that would most likely drag him to the chopping block h [/INST] ad appeared since he had dropped down. Suddenly the woman across the room materialized two green liquids from her pockets. Quickly he realized that the only way he would make it out this fight without being skinned would be to choose a side. ""Damn these Holyoke politics! Who are the bad guys?"" he asked over top of the calling voices. ""It sounds as if you're all fighting over who gets to defend the king"" </s>"
18,"<s>[INST] I'd like to hear this man out first before I give my final verdict.
Corraidhìn needed to think fast.The king was obviously no fool. What could he say that would be believable at this point? ""I'm a... uhh, mercenary! Offering his proffesional service to you and your nation. I was making my way to stand before you to offer me and my men, when I saw that you might be in danger, and so I rushed in to help, [/INST] thinking he was an assassin! That's when i noticed that he wasn't an assassin, but it was too late."" he lied. It could be half believable, which is only as much as he needed to escape the throne room alive. ""I cordially apologize for my rather rude entry. I hope you understand."" He placed his mace back in his belt, and his spell book back In his pocket. He turned to Nathan. ""Feeling suicidal, are we?"" </s>"
19,"<s>[INST] Siia was a bit suspicious about the woman's actions though it wasn't enough at the moment to get her to pull out her trump card aside from her Broniac. The way that woman was acting didn't fool her at all and she knew exactly what she was up to. She couldn't really make her move until this whole problem resolved itself. She ignored Nathan's words since they were just useless conjecture that had no place. Turning her attention away from Azmaldus she knew that the true enemy was the one who was acting innocent. It would be hard to persuade the King that his own adviser was trying to defile him and she knew by the way Nathan was acting that she did something to him and her antidote she gave him was taking its precious time to take effect. That woman could try anything, but as long as she was able to see into the future, her actions would always be predictable toward her. She closed her eyes and sighed that this primitive mortal was trying to cause so much havoc. It was self-explanatory that any Xian would want to stain the Guardia throne with the blood of its last King.
""I advise you think your decision over most closely, King Razhard. I'm disappointed with your response, but I will give you another chance to change your mind."" Drausius concluded as he looked over toward Chloris who ordered her soldiers to let him pass allowing him to leave the throne room. Ishtora and Azmaldus as accompanied him toward the door as well. ""I shall return at another point in time, Razhard. I expect a better answer next time. Your duty is toward your people not some personal trinket."" He reminded Razhard as he and the other two accompanied him left the throne room. Before Azmaldus left Meira yelled out his name where he turned around and shook his head, ""Fate has cast us as enemies. I expect you to honor that decision, grandchild and please remain at my daughter's side."" He paused for a moment as he stepped forward toward Meira and caressed her cheek, ""You look so much like your my daughter who is your mother. She would be proud of what you've become and I am too. Though we may have different resolves, my love for you Meira won't change. Take care of yourself. Perhaps you can stop me from doing something horrible in the future."" Those were his final words as Drausius called his name where he obeyed and left the room with Drausius.
Meira wasn't completely satisfied with what Azmaldus said toward h [/INST] er. There were questions she wanted answers to, but he didn't give her the chance to ask them. He just said his piece and left which irritated her. She didn't understand why her grandfather had become the man he was now. Moreover why was he working with the Pangaea Order and what did Siia exactly mean by he betrayed her? Was she in love with this man at one time? Meira thought in surprise.
Razhard listened to Corraidhin's piece then gave his final verdict on what he was going to do, ""I've heard of Ytrelia and if you're from that continent then there is no doubt you're a mercenary. You're probably familiar with Vermilia and Ibelia which are the two largest nations lead by mercenaries so I'm guessing you're from one of those nations."" She then ordered one of his soldiers over toward him with a bag of Alura. He then threw the Alura at Corradhin where he continued, ""I shall accept your services then. That is one hundred thousand Alura. I'm sure that is more than enough to compensate you for hiring your services.""
Luther and Chloris didn't like the King's decision, but they would accept it nonetheless. They weren't ones to argue since they could only honor his decision hoping he would not regret it one day. Chloris ordered her soldiers afterward to stand aside, but to stick at the entrances and increase guard security around the castle so nothing like this could happen again. Like Siia though, she also didn't like the Aira woman nor did Luther. Luther always tried to avoid talking to the woman since everything she said was just a bunch of nonsense he didn't want to listen to.
""Member of a cult are you?"" Siia questioned with suspicion lit in her eyes. ""I have my doubts toward your trustworthiness and I don't trust you at all. Though I will not openly oppose you, I will give you firm warning. If you do anything that I should deem impractical you will die right where you stand. So I will advise you to cease what ever you are up to even if it is what I suspect which is to arouse the hatred in a certain individual's heart to erupt in merciless massacre."" She threatened as she formed an empty magic circle on her hand with no symbols on it.
""I've studied your kind and you use Mana on Xi. But I know an art that surpasses even Mana. You could not comprehend how powerful my magic is nor would you understand this art I know that usurps all other forms of magic. It isn't Holy Magic either."" </s>"
20,"<s>[INST] Aira smiled inwardly, despite Siia's and Nathan's threats, they couldn't touch her. To the king, she is a respectable adviser and a ""proud"" member of one of his kingdoms. If either of them attacked, or even killed her, they would face the kingdom's wrath and she would be protected. While she can't use her magic in the king's presents, if worst came to worst, she would be able to use her magics and protect herself against the fools, and she would be able to use her potions and poisons without qualms.
""King Razhard, you should settle your dispute with these others kingdoms later as both a dragon and a witch is at your door. That boy there is a dragonite, and I suspect him to be a spy of the Dragonia nation. And that strange figure i [/INST] s a witch and a slanderer, she claims me to be not loyal and that I am some kind of cultist in my own head! She is using a magic that doesn't even use esir which is forbidden in this fine kingdom. You know even in the troubled times of Xi, we, the nobles of Xi, will stand strong with our king! Now, please king, arrest these traitors and witches! I doubt those girls with those two are any more innocent of treason!"" she shouted.
She acted like she had no clue what Psygonics was, but the cult had informed of this magic. She knew it was powerful and was unaffected by cursed magic, but if the hag would kill her now after this claim, she would only confirm that group was untrustworthy and evil, and she would make her final moments count. </s>"
21,"<s>[INST] Yes my liege said Corraidhin as he left for the door. Razhard's orders were quite confusing to him. He led the troops through the castle, muttering as he planned his course of action. ""Don't kill the sexy ones, do kill the creepy-bitchy ones and their not so creepy husbands, and the halfbreed, unless you can tell them that they don't need to die, which is the most unlikely situation for the halfbreed, and bring the holy weapons once you've killed the not-sexy ones and kidnapped the sexy ones [/INST] ."" They emerged from the palace and into the bustling streets of Windgrace. ""Right, so if I was a creepy mage where would i go?"" Suddenly, a bridge down the street cracked in two. ""That's where"" he said, and he led the soldiers toward the bridge. He got there just in time to see his prey running through the crowd on the other side. ""Damn! No use following them this way."" They ran along the side of the canal looking for another bridge. At long last they found one and made their way across it. </s>"
22,"<s>[INST] Corraidhin led the soldiers toward where the fugitives had stopped in front of a group of Dragon Knights. He had been hoping for a way to surround them. ""Like rats drawn to cheese they have wandered into a trap"" he said. But he had spoke too soon. Suddenly a brilliant pegasus emerged before Meira, and she and the whelp mounted quickly. Then one of the Dragon Knights dressed in very revealing armor met them on the ground. They exchanged words he could not hear, and then Meira drew her sword. She delivered a speech with great confidence and persuasion, and the Pegasus Knights who had appeared and the Dragon Knights were with her. The creepy people with them ascended their mounts, and before him stood a battalion of Horsemen sitting upon great beasts. He quickly glanced over one of the buildings on the side of the street, and in the doorway he saw a most curious thing. He saw four people staring directly at him. Then he recognized them. They were regia, whom he had rounded up from the academy in Ytrellia, l [/INST] ed by one of his good friends, Amulius Karna.
Amulius Karna:
What are they doing here? he thought to himself. They must have taken his advice and fled for Ereis Eisan. A devilish smirk spread across Corraidhin's face. He pulled a cigar out of his pocket, put it in his mouth, and lit it up from a flame at the end of his thumb. He took a puff and then took it out of his mouth. ""Forgot how to fight fair have we, princess?"" called Corraidhin to the princess. ""Just call in daddy's friends to help when things might be looking tough, eh? Too bad for me most of my friends are dead, or I'd call them in to give you a run for your money."" He looked down at his cigar. ""Lucky for me I've still got a trick or two up my sleeve"" he said as the four people emerged from their hiding spot. Corraidhin threw his cigar to the ground and took his spell book out of his pocket. ""Melloah!"" He recited a spell and stepped on the lit cigar. Suddenly, flames began to circle around him like bees around a hive. ""Come on then cutie-pie!"" </s>"
23,"<s>[INST] Aira frowned at this turn of events. This is going to interfere with there plans, with this new man's ambitions, he would want to control all of Holyote and maybe even Gaia, causing the balance of power to be a non issue and the cult could not have this. She would have to abort her mission anyways, she knew working this closely with a man who uses evil magics would be to risky to herself and the cult. She needed to attack quickly while the man wasn't fully in control. As she worked her magics, she remarked, ""I am sorry, but I know how evil maniacs like you want, I know because I work for some, and I am sorry, I can't let you [/INST] have even this single nation, much less all of Holyote or Gaia, my superiors wouldn't allow it."" and when she finished, she was already gone. She sent a quick surge of cursed magic though the air to disturb the connection between the king and whatever was possessing him, she had converted the potion she gave the king into a deadly contact poison and caused it to explode, and she dived out the window and vanished without even looking back at what happened.
Fenrir just snarled some more and said, ""No, I don't need your pity, I just wish you would leave me alone."" When Fenrir realized the inn was burning, he casually walked out. </s>"
24,"<s>[INST] One of the soldiers looked back at Armand and asked if they should pursue. Armand just shook his head and put his bow back on his back. He felt something dark when he took a glance back at the castle and noticed dark clouds were forming around it. He decided to let Corraidhin and the rest of the guard deal with the situation and made his way back toward the castle. The other house members that were approaching immediately head back to the castle once they noticed the same thing that Armand did. They didn't even take the time to evaluate the situation. They had to hurry back, because their King might be in trouble. One of Armand's soldiers asked if they should pursue where he coldly answered with a fierce look on face after feeling that nasty aura in the air, ""No. Let that man deal with them. I have no interest of getting mixed up with the Order's Mage Knights so we'll just pull back to the castle and see what is going on there."" He said as the soldier acknowledged him and made his way back to the castle along with Armand's other Arch Knights.
The pegasus and dragon knights that divided from the group were still engaged into battle with the soldiers still providing time for the others to escape while they lay down their lives. Soldiers and mounted troops fell one by one as they showered the ground in blood as the common people tried to find shelter from the massacre outside.
Azmaldus redirected his mount back in the direction of the redezvous once he saw the boy that was riding with Meira stopped her. He saw flopping around and kicking while riding on his shoulders, but he was relieved to see she was safe now. He ordered his troops to fall back toward the Orders Mage Knights where they would make their way out of the capital. He also noticed that the other houses backed off and went straight for the castle. He thought something happened there, but he didn't have time to go see what was going on. He had to lead these people to safety as soon as possible.
Directing her attention toward the man she sighed at him, ""You really shouldn't just concern yourself with just one enemy. I don't know if you're too stupid or just reckless not to realize I had prepared a spell before hand. Take a look toward the sky behind you and see what your careless has done to you. I could kill you, but I'd gain nothing from doing so and I'm not about to kill an animal that can't defend itself so instead I'll do this."" She said as she pointed in the sky toward her giant sword of darkness flickering with dark lightning bolts around the glyph it is situated around. When Siia saw the man had hitched a ride on Meira's pegasus where she halted at trying to use her spell at that time, she realized this was a golden opportunity. She thought a moment about the situation and if she should use it anyway knowing full well that Meira's pegasus would probably be killed. She then shook her head and decided she'd instead use it to slow that man down and possibly try to get him off that pegasus by startling it with her spell. She turned the sword of darkness that was showered by dark purple lightning bolts then closed her hand activating the spell once she aimed just enough of a safe distance so Meira's pegasus wouldn't take a hit. Right when she noticed Nathan used a gust of wind to slow the pegasus down she closed her palm and the giant sword of darkness shot forward like a lightning bolt in an inclined position. It wasn't long before it hammered the ground just a few feet away from the pegasus where it erupted in a dark fiery explosion which startled the pegasus and caused it to go up on its two feet. She wasn't trying to kill anyone, just stall them long enough for Nathan to make his way toward the group. The man hadn't been paying any attention toward her which was a fatal mistake he made and now he had to deal with a startled pegasus that stopped abruptly scared. Stalagmite shards flew everyone from the dark explosion which enveloped the area in front of the man. Luckily she fired her spell just far enough in front he could just feel the intensity of the blast. The explosion swallowed up several structures reducing them to ruin quickly where wood chunks and cement fragments laid in ruin as the structures were completely destroyed in the blast. ""Hmph, second rate magic user. You're lucky to still be alive and that I was kind enough to spare you. Next time, you won't be so fortunate if you aren't aware of your surroundings. Let that be a warning and lesson to you."" She said in a not impressed look as she kept her head focused toward the rear as her passenger steered her mount. It was obvious she wasn't impressed by the man's skill with magic and she was even more dissuaded with his reckless martyr nature which bored her to say the least. A mage should always be aware of their surroundings and not rush in half-cocked. It was something she taught all her students that she used to teach magic. Even if this man wasn't her student, he still needed training to be able to match her wits.
""PUT ME DOWN!"" Meira exclaimed as she struggled kicking and screaming in Nathan's grasp. She wanted to be put down and she was red hot at the moment after Nathan just swept her off her feet and forced her over his shoulder like a kidnapper. Meira could only lay on his shoulder since there was no way she could get free without having to resort to hurting Nathan. She kept her sword gripped tight thoug [/INST] h the fiery anger in her eyes indicated that she was really mad now. ""YOU HAVE SOME NERVE GRABBING ME LIKE THAT AND TREATING ME LIKE A SACK!!! I SAID LET ME GO THIS INSTANT! IF YOU DON'T..."" Meira wasn't able to finish that statement since she had just noticed that the man hijacked her pegasus which made her even boil in more anger. Her eyes seared with irritation since she didn't want him on her pegasus. She also saw Siia use a powerful dark magic to stall the person.
Meanwhile back at the castle, Xhosa was agonizing in pain after what that woman had done to him. Razhard's body was being destroyed and there was nothing he could do. He was enraged by what that woman had done and when Eurasia tried to cling onto him to save him she was caught in the aftermath of it as well as it began to eat away at her body. ""NO!"" Alicia screamed in tears as she tried to run at the two only to have a dark figure appear right before her.
The dark figure pushed the girl into the hands of another man while he approached the decaying King. He motioned his hand and extracted Xhosa's spirit from the body and forced it back into the spear. He then took his other hand grabbed the King and generated his dark aura into his body where he gripped tight with his fist and shattered the cursed energy destroying it stopping the decay process with his hand as remnants of the curse cinched his hand burning it with blood coming out of his hand which only made him grin. ""Such pathetic cursed energy. Even a child could conjure such a primitive technique."" He said as the darkness on his hands devoured the curse that tried to damage his body. What was left of Razhard and Eurasia's bodies hit the floor. He decided to show Alicia mercy by not devouring them and instead gave her a chance to properly bury them when she calmed down and became more rational. ""In the end, you were nothing but a fool Razhard. No matter, that pathetic cult is nothing more than a pebble in the road. I will kick it aside soon enough. For now, I must formulate a new strategy.""
""LET ME GO!"" Alicia exclaimed trying to get out of the hands of the devilish man who held her tight in his grasp. The man was getting irritated trying to get her to calm down where he decided to strike her in the gut, but the other figure shook his head. He grabbed some rope coiling it around her wrists where he finally looped it between her hands preventing her from trying to squeeze her hands out of it. The girl was terrified at the sight she just saw. Both her brother and sister had been murdered. She attempted to bite her tongue only to have the man pull a limp piece of cloth in between her lips to cleave gag her with as he double-knotted it tight and tied it off behind her neck as it fastened tight in between her lips, ""I can't have you dying so don't even think about biting your tongue."" The man ordered her as she moaned into the cloth.
""Just settle down, Princess Alicia. We are not your enemy."" The man with red eyes that looked very young reminded her as he attempted to try to get her to settle down so they could talk with her. He told the other individual to plant her on the throne seat where he tied her to it to make her comfortable as she probably didn't like being squeezed that hard. He saw Alicia wanted to scream, but her cleave prevented her from doing so where muffled words came out of her mouth.
""What are we going to do now, Lord Ariesu? That woman killed the only person who could wield Daeslurph."" He reminded Ariesu as he grabbed one of the chairs off to the side and took a seat in it.
""There isn't only one wielder of that spear, Utrunos."" He revealed as he pulled up a seat as well as they waited for the girl to settle down. They knew the horror of watching her two family die was painful and she just needed to sit down and restrain herself for awhile.
""What do you mean?"" He questioned as he turned toward Alicia seeing that she was starting to calm down a bit. He then saw Ariesu reach over and grab the spear that lay on the ground. Unlike Razhard, the spear's curse had no effect on Ariesu.
""There were two children from the family that could wield the spear. One was Razhard and the second is Princess Alicia who we managed to save before she killed herself. That foolish woman Aira overlooked an important fact making a fatal mistake. Her weak primitive magic does not phase me in the slightest either. It's mere child's play to me as I can conjure spells that are weaker and make them twice as powerful. That foolish feeble-minded ingrate for a mortal thought she could interfere with my plans? How foolish can that cult be? They are no match for me nor do they pose a threat."" He answered as he kept one hand with a spell conjured where he spoke toward the girl again in a usual tone, ""If you agree to not bite your tongue or scream I'll remove your gag."" She nodded in compliance as he used the other hand and reaching over toward Alicia's mouth pulling the gag out of her mouth which now lay limp around her neck like a necklace.
""Who are you two?"" She questioned sniffling still as tears rolled down her face in sadness as she finally settled down and just sat quietly in the throne chair noticing that the man evaporated all the evil from it. She had never saw either figure before and they just appeared out of nowhere. Also, the one who held the cursed spear scared the daylights out of her. She wanted nothing to do with that spear. </s>"
25,"<s>[INST] Ariesu looked at the girl when she questioned who he was. He wasn't entirely sure if he should give her his actual name or continue to use his cover name he's been using to hide himself on Gaea. He wasn't especially fond of human, but the girl was only half human which didn't bother him much. He looked over toward one of his mages seeing the shattered glass from the window someone had gone out of. He presumed that Aira woman had fled out the window and that everyone else would be going to see what was going on upstairs in the throne room. Even though he knew it was futile to go look for her he had one of his minions go out the window she did and search for clues even if they were small clues. ""I doubt going after that woman will do us any good, but jump out that window and survey the area. You might find even a fragment that I can use out there. I don't care how small the clue is. Just bring it back to me."" He ordered one of his minions in the room to do as they walked over toward the window and jumped out of it themselves.
""PRINCESS ALICIA!!!"" Guards said that entered room to notice that the area had become a slaughter fest. They noticed two corpses on the ground which they knew were both the King and Princess Eurasia. They also saw several guard corpses on the ground that were in the same state as the other two corpses on the ground. They then saw two unknown figures where they inquired who they were and saw their princess tied to the throne chair. She shook her head when they tried to approach and ordered them to stand down. Even though they were hesitant to do so they obeyed her orders anyway. She ordered them to stick by the entrances and ordered one guard to go over toward the window and keep watch over it.
""The name is Ariesu, Princess Alicia. I find your people quite interesting and I will enlist my aid to help you restore the damage that was inflicted by that wretched woman. You need not worry about the pathetic cult she comes from. As long as I remain here, they won't dare try to stand in your way."" He advised the princess as he grabbed a dagger from Utronos and cut her binds away including the ones that bound her wrists.
Meanwhile just outside the castle the dark platinum haired man that wielded Ichivail had returned to the castle with his Arch Knights. He inquired from the guard what was going and wanted a status report on the situation and the damage inflicted by the incident that just happened. The guards weren't entirely sure how much damage the castle sustained or the well-being of their King. All they could tell him is what they've investigated so far has minimal damages and that they had cleared out the gaggle of dead bodies someone else had laid in their wake when storming the castle. ""Shall I serve as an escort, Duke Armand?"" He questioned toward Armand who shook his head no. Armand decided that he would investigate the situation himself so he could understand what was going on. The guard inquired why he had left the castle earlier where Armand told him simply he was just dealing with a problem in the city. Then he informed him that it was nothing to worry about and that he should just remain on alert in case other intruders try to force their way into the castle. Armand entered the castle and had his Arch Knights standby to guard the main entrance to the castle and then ordered a select few to guard the other two entrances to ensure that security was tight.
""Armand!"" A soldier ran over while he was about to enter the castle doors. Armand frowned as he turned his attention toward the guard. By the look on the guard's face what he had to say looked urgent. ""Out with it already."" Armand said impatient as he had no time to waste.
""A woman was spotted that had just jumped out one of the windows. We tried to pursue her, but we lost her. And those who kept up with her were found dead. Their bodies were completely decayed like they had been buried for many years."" The soldier said toward Armand which concerned him. He then inquired toward the guard what the woman looked like and when the guard gave the description of her he immediately ran into the castle headed straight for the throne room.
Ingrid Ingrassia (Chloris mother): 
Lenisk Ingrassia (Chloris father): 
""Baron Lenisk and Baroness Ingrid, we have secured the castle though we don't exactly know what happened in the throne room."" One of the soldiers said as he saw an orange haired man and a silver haired woman approaching them on armored horses. Lenisk was armed with his angelic like sword and Ingrid had her spear at her disposal if she needed it. Neither looked very pleased as they both had looks of displeasure slapped on their faces. Lenisk stopped his horse near the entrance of the castle where his wife Ingrid pulled up right beside him. ""What is going on? Wh [/INST] y did I see my daughter killing Guardia troops?"" He questioned unhappy about the fact his daughter was killing their own soldiers. He wanted to go after her and force her to come to her senses, but the King was in danger so he'd deal with her at another time.

Meanwhile when Nathan finally put Meira down that is when Azmaldus jumped down from his dragon he was riding happy to see she was okay. He wasn't going to scold her there for what she had done, it would be a waste of time. Now that they had met up with Drausius Mage Knights the soldiers that pursued them all backed off and returned to the city. A few surviving pegasus and dragon knight units were also seen flying toward the city gates. He shook his head at what Nathan had said, because he didn't know that Meira's father abandoned her when she was still an infant. ""I'm afraid, boy you don't understand her anger at all. Meira hates her father for the fact he abandoned her when she was just an infant and left her in the care of her mother. But when Meira was nearing her teens, her mother one day vanished without a trace. Not too long after that happened Queen Erialyss of Windgrace agreed to raise her. There is no excuse for her actions, no. But go throwing around words so foolishly without asking her why she feels that way is rather thinking close-minded. You must respect her decisions no matter how foolish they may be. That's part of being a leader and I'm sure she has accepted the responsibility and consequences from them. The only part I didn't appreciate was the fact you were continuing on which is ridicule and I'm sure she might have been insulted. Not by the fact you scold her, but rather by the lack of restraint in your words. Just say your piece and leave it as that. There's no need to drive things into the ground by continuing to talk about such a subject."" He reminded the boy as he approached Meira and took her into his hands hugging her. Meira thought her grandfather was going to scold her for what she did, but instead he didn't.
""I'm just glad you're okay."" He paused for a moment raising his voice for the next couple of statements he made, ""But don't ever go into battle without using rational thought, Meira! You're not alone even if you think you are. Your life is not something you can just so easily throw away like a piece of tissue paper. There are those who care about you dearly. So please regard their feelings before you think about being selfish again."" He paused once more lowering his tone back toward a fatherly like one, ""Besides, I don't need to tell you what happened to myself when I did the samething.""
""Don't you think that's a bit much, granny?"" Whizzle said to no one, recognizing the person who's reckless enough to throw the spell freely. ""Hmm, wonder what should I do...""
Siia knew that voice only by the word ""granny"" because there was only one person who ever addressed her by that name and if they didn't want to get sold out they should have chose another alias. She sighed a bit when she heard the word, but didn't really hear if it was male or female, where she was irritated by being called granny. She was still a beautiful woman and she has retained her youth. She found such a moniker rather insulting though she did allow just him to address her that way. Both Chloris and Luther climbed off the mounts they were riding as Meira's mount regrouped with her standing right beside her as her grandfather continued to hug her and hold her in his grasp. ""You again..."" Were the only words Siia could manage since she wasn't entirely pleased to see the person who she thought it was again who called her by that. Ever since she saw the person she was thinking about the last time when her sister was still around, she had always wanted to avoid contact with him. It wasn't that she hated him, just that he found his behavior obnoxious and sometimes obstinate. ""I guess it's fate that brought us back together."" She let out of deep sight that echoed around the area that almost everyone could hear. Ranathia who was right beside her didn't say a word. She didn't have anything to say toward the person though she was rather curious how Siia and that person in the sky with blue wings knew each other.
Drausius, his wife Ishtora following alongside him and his Mage Knights approached the group. His expression was pretty normal and it didn't look like he entirely cared that they made it out of the city safely. Still he would assist them in their endeavor since he owed a debt to Siia still. Knowing that they couldn't stick around the gates of the capital he advised the group, ""We should be going. The sooner we get away from Ereis Eisan, the better."" </s>"
26,"<s>[INST] Whatever reply Nathan had for Azmaldus was lost when he heard him utter something that baffled him ""feelings? I barely know her. I mean sure, I kind of remember her from the academy, but that's more because of her hair color then anything else...truth be told, she's the only person I remember from the academy."" Realizing he had gotten off topic, Nathan shook his head and continued ""but anyway. The only things I really know about her is that she's a princess"" he cringed as he said the word princess ""calling her cutie pie or talking about her dad is [/INST] enough to get her into a rage, and what I was just told about her past. That's not enough to establish any sort of attraction. Besides, even if I did have feeling for her, it wouldn't really matter. After all, I'm just a-"" he was about to saw monster, but corrected himself at the last second ""-commoner. While she's a princess. She's going to get her very own prince charming to sweep her off her feat for her own happily ever after. Being neither a prince or charming, I'd only get in the way. So in the end, it doesn't matter how I feel"" he finished </s>"
27,"<s>[INST] You seem to misunderstood. I was trying to tell you to shut your stupid mouth. Now, do you still want to keep talking and have me make your insides be your outside? If not, scram and leave me alone, semi-human. And so you know, pure-blood werewolves aren't even related to humans. he said. He didn't really hate, hate humans, but all of the races expect the vampires and vompryes, humans s [/INST] eemed to be the most hateful towards werewolves, so being human, or part human.
He then realized another voice talking to him, something about leaving the person who approached him alone. He wasn't really paying her much mind. ""Fine"" he muttered, throwing the guy towards a wall. He didn't put any effort into making it hurt, nor did he care if he got hurt. And slowly started to walk off. </s>"
28,"<s>[INST] Fenrir rushed over to the random citizen who asked ""What is his problem"", and went to knock him down, forgetting he was in werewolf form and as such had claws. He wasn't thinking, and he didn't put to much force behind it, but his claw [/INST] s were very sharp so it did cause a solid cut, but nothing major. It cause him to very slightly bleed as the guy fell over. ""My problems are my problems."" he said, walking away and not even noticing how badly he injured the random guy. </s>"
29,"<s>[INST] Just leave me alone, unless you want to be dog meat. Do you even know who I am? I might as well tell you, I am Fenrir, the beast of Cimmeria. he basically shouted out. He started to make various wolf noises, which some one who spe [/INST] aks traditional lycanthrope (wolf-like) would recognize as ""Gaia, planet where I am, call forth your vines and underbrush to give me aid."" as vines grew from the ground and wrapped around Fenrir's feet and pulled him to the ground. </s>"
30,"<s>[INST] Just leave me alone, unless you want to be dog meat. Do you even know who I am? I might as well tell you, I am Fenrir, the beast of Cimmeria. He basically shouted out.
""No, I don't know who you are nor do I care. Your name and words mean absolutely nothing to me. This is a battlefield so prepare yourself otherwise leave this place at once and never return here ever!"" Meira ignored his pathetic insult and taunt. She had fallen victim to such foolishness earlier where she smiled and said proudly toward the werewolf, ""Mules bray and fools talk, but the wise girl listens not."" She smirked with a rush of confidence in her body as she wasn't going to be driven in by such asinine words. She finished her statement with a taunt like response, ""Don't bite your tongue now. Not everyone can enlighten themselves with wisdom!"" She boasted in a sarcastic taunt like manner. Ignoring anything else he said and turning her head to make sure Ranathia acknowledged she decided to make her next move.
She paid absolutely no attention to what Fenrir was doing and didn't even think to look at him for one moment as she jumped down off her pegasus ignoring any noises and rather than listening with her ears she interpreted judgment with her mind. She felt the energy in the air then used the electrical current she generated into her body to slow her fall toward the ground giving her a soft landing. So quick before anyone could notice she shot a ball of electrical charged force into the sky which disappeared out of sight as it headed skyward. She then took her spear and planted it into the ground. She remembered what she had been taught and when Nature Magic was being used. She also knew the great weakest of Nature Magic which was to use forbidden unholy magic which purpose was to distort and twist life energy to the point where it can be destroyed. She drew her sword then concentrated her mind as she hummed something in ancient script where a crimson red pentagram style glyph appeared below her feet. She then drew Ranathia's gravitational energy her magic circle as she continued her hymn. She transformed Ranathia's gravitational energy into a dark aura. The aura started to erupt around Ranathia's gravitational energy as Meira's body was engulfed by the dark energy she embraced. The ground started to shake as dark clouds began to cover the horizon and block out any light. Ranathia felt a bit uneasy since she could feel the darkness that was erupting from the ground that Meira began to summon. She was a bit scared since she didn't think Ranathia could control Kreosus awesome power and summon the Dragon of the Destruction Flame, one of Kreosus beasts. She did know that what she was using would eliminate any chances at trying to use Nature Magic since like Holy Magic, unholy arts were its greatest weakness.
""Force of destruction, entity that relieves those of misery. I shall embrace
the wickedness of your twilight. I shall understand the decaying essence that
erases existence. Rise forward for the darkest hour is nigh! I release your chains
to unveil the chaos that spirals out of control as it devours the hands of time.""
As the ground began to shake violent a violent dark purplish energy broke through the surface causing stalagmite pieces to fly everywhere. The dark twilight that ascended from the depths of the deepest darkness as Meira tried to withstand the uneasiness of the energy began to take shape in the form of a serpent like dragon which curled itself around Meira's spear standing right in front of her releasing its dark aura into the air which started to kill the plants that were around her as they decayed into ashes. The dragon peered at him with its scarlet red eyes as it awaited her command.
Ranathia did the same as Meira and ignored any sounds from the air. She like Ranathia had learned from their teacher that you are not to listen to magic. You are to feel its embrace with your entire body and listen to it by feeling its essence. She remembered that they were taught that since most charms only worked if you used certain senses of the body. It was something she herself knew too well knowing that even the most elite of magic users doesn't rely on their normal senses. Ranathia used the dark cloud formation to use her magic and show what the Mjolnir [/INST] Tome was capable of. Before she started her incantation she threw something on the ground, but it was so small that no one could notice what it was. A small thread of light implanted itself into the ground and quickly dissipated into nothingness as what she threw on the ground shattered into a sparkle of light after what was in it escaped. Ranathia was saying something from her lips as she threw on the ground, but her tone was too silent to notice what she had said.
She like Meira concentrated her energy closing her eyes as the symbol on her hand appeared on the ground and sky in the form of a large yellowish glyph that peered outward several feet. While she concentrated her thoughts and remained compose she then recited in her mind keeping in synch with Meira's incantation as she could hear Meira's words as the two opened their minds to each other.
""Heavenly lightning that roars within the heavens
answering the call to salvation bring forth judgment.""
""The power of decay returns all to ashen ruin. Nothing can escape its claws of destruction, an endowment I shall utilize with dignity and I embrace the very embodiment of energy that causes all to return to oblivion."" Meira said toward Fenrir with confidence just awaiting his next action or response.
""The power of two reigns chaos on all those who are unjustified! Your sins shall not go unpunished, ruthless fiend! We will show you how the power of opposites works!"" Ranathia exclaimed as she was still keeping her spell on standby.
Peering toward the clouds, Ranathia jumped off her mount then she meditated as she drew the electrical force from the dark clouds formed and generated them into a series of electrical energy balls that appeared around the large glyph she had erected below her and above her head. Though she didn't say the last part of the spell yet as she waited to see what exactly the werewolf was going to do so she could make her next move in accordance. She like Meira waited before they reacted and were about to show what these two moves they conjured could do. Electrical energy caressed Ranathia's body like a wild beast as dark energy hissed around Meira making a snake like sound as it continued to emanate around her.
Meanwhile Drausius and the others continued to ride forward in the forest while Azmaldus felt a powerful aura that erupted in the city. He also saw that Meira wasn't anywhere to be seen either. ""Huh."" He sighed where he caught a glimpse of a boy and girl on the ground then noticed it was Nathan and the girl who mysteriously decided to tag along with the group. Though he didn't know her motives, he saw that she was practically harmless. He told his group to continue without him as he landed his dragon in the forest. He unmounted and made his way over toward Nathan and the girl where he questioned seeing that there was some kind of problem, ""Did something happen here?"" He questioned toward the two confused a bit about what was going on. He then examined the situation and noticed the girl had damaged her wing. Like any gentlemen toward a lady he rose down on one knee and gave his hand out to the girl, ""Are you okay, miss? Is there something I can do to ease your pain at all?"" He asked her as he didn't like to see any girl suffer no matter what his age was. It was also in his nature to be a gentlemen toward any female. He then looked at her eyes and noticed they were closed shaking his head finally realizing that she was unconscious.
""I'll carry her."" Azmaldus offered as he reached down and took the girl into his two hands. ""While I'm carrying her, head back to town and see if that is where Meira went off to. She ran off again without saying a word and seeing as Ranathia isn't around either, I'm betting she went back to see if Ranathia needed help."" He nodded as he walked over toward his dragon and told it to go on without him and that he would carry the girl the rest of the way. It had been the first time he had carried a girl like this in a long time. The last time he had to carry a girl like he did was when his beloved Finathia when she was young and they were unmarried slipped and hit her head on a rock knocking herself unconscious. ""I'm counting on you, boy!"" He winked as he started to walk away with the girl in his hands. ""This brings back memories..."" </s>"
31,"<s>[INST] Whizzle listened to Nathan's rambling, questions forming in her head and hiding a smirk. The boy must have been either too serious or a bit dense. She then felt the healing power washing over her, it was too little to do much about her wing but it did soothe the pain. Whizzle was about to 'woke up' when she heard a set of flapping wings and something landing nearby before hearing a new voice. Fighting a forming frown and an urge to curse, Whizzle remained still as the new voice went closer and spoke to her, ""Are you okay, miss? Is there something I can do to ease your pain at all?"" he said. Now Whizzle refrained from chuckling before the man offered to carry her and proceeded to do so soon after. It was incredibly hard not to let out the disappointed sigh that she felt.
The ma [/INST] n then spoke to Nathan, telling the latter to head back and look for Meira and Ranathia. Nathan said his answer before a sound of a constant fire stream can be heard from his direction before going upwards and disappearing, which Whizzle assumed as Nathan showing what he meant with how he can fly earlier. Whizzle remained still for a few more seconds before quietly opening her eyes and looked around before settling her an annoyed gaze at Azmaldus.
""Can you put me down, please?"" She said, adding the latter in a tone saying it wasn't a request. Regardless of Azmaldus' reaction, be it by putting her down or insisting, Whizzle would then retract her wings, the Midarians inherent shapeshifting meant lasting wounds didn't mean much as long as they have the power to change their form. </s>"
32,"<s>[INST] No, he didn't say anything bad about my parents. He rather carelessly attacked an innocent bystander badly injuring them. She said to Nathan as she pointed in the direction of the man who laid unconscious on the ground from Fenrir's assault. Seeing that he had evaded Ranathia's Rebinrimitto she decided it was time for her to go on the offensive. She anticipated that he would pay no attention to some of her earlier actions as she saw her orb of electrical energy had shot back down and was hovering a several feet above her head. Ranathia's electrical attack collided with an abandoned building then slam into it ripping the door open along with collapsing some of the walls around the structure as it dissipated into nothingness. She looked at Fenrir and the only words that came out of her mouth in response to what he said was, ""I don't expect someone who doesn't value life to understand my resolve nor would I waste my breath explaining the reason to you."" She saw he had moved is when she propelled herself into the air using her dark purple energy emanating from her fists. She palmed both her hands out in front of her as she formed a purple dark ball of energy. Her ball of energy had returned and it wasn't a ball of energy anymore as it slowly lowered itself just a few feet above in the shape of sharp electrical energy blades where there were several of them that did rotations above her head. Now that her first attack had manifested itself and now she was about ready with her second she moved one of her palmed out hands where she carved a glyph with her finger that she would use if Fenrir decided to carelessly attack her. If he did attack her while she was levitated, he would not only find out what that glyph she drew was for, but also would succumb to her painful blades above her head.
""Not bad."" Ranathia said as she prepared her second wave for a different kind of attack. She saw Ranathia had boosted herself airborne and was preparing for another attack where Ranathia concentrated her energy into her electrical balls of energy and modified her original glyph changing the type of attack she was about to use by just using her mind which sped up the process of preparing her next magical strike. She was surprised by Nathan's arrival like Meira, but now wasn't the time to be talking. She grinned as she saw Fenrir had started to dash at full pace. It was exactly what she wanted him to do. She waited with her magical attack seeing what his next move was. She would then decide whether it would be time to reveal what she had done earlier that he didn't pay much attention to. She was pretty sure she had given what she did earlier when she was on her mount plenty of time to manifest.
""What's going on over there?"" Soldiers questioned as they saw a commotion near the entrance of the city. They all marched immediately to investigate what was going on. The guard captain lead the way for the group as they made their way over toward the four individuals near the gate. Just as they tried to get closer a man dressed in black appeared in front of them. The soldiers immediately stop and salute the man, ""Lord Rushif [/INST] a, what brings you out here?""

""I will handle this."" He said as he turned away from the soldiers walking over toward the fight. One of the soldiers questions him by saying, ""But."" He shake his head and makes it clear with his voice that he intends to deal with the problem. The soldiers nod their heads and decide to return to their posts. They apologize for wasting Rushifa's time, but he only ignores them.
The man dressed in black walks over toward a building then leans against it as he grins. He looks over in the direction of the pink haired girl then closes his eyes and smiles for a moment, ""You've indeed gotten stronger both mentally and physically..."" He paused for a moment as he continued to observe her actions. He paid absolutely no attention toward her opponent since he was only interested in watching her. ""To think I married your mother to help bring you into this world..."" Again another pause he smiled once again pleased with what he was seeing out of her. ""You are indeed worthy of being my daughter. I never thought I'd give life to a child. I was always so hateful of mortals, but I guess perhaps it was your mother that opened my eyes. Perhaps such beings are worthy of my recognition. I understand being forgotten by gods all too well... Perhaps you will light the path toward defeating him..."" He said as he didn't complete his statement just leaving it as ""him"".
Meanwhile the girl says something that humors Azmaldus, ""Why, my lord, my name is too insignificant for someone of your stature to remember, let alone notice,"" She sweetly replied.
What the girl had said made Azmaldus chuckle. She was right, he was once a ruler of a large and powerful nation, but after the assault from the Cimmerian Empire. It had fallen to pieces and he was the only one who managed to safely move his daughter out of the castle before she was captured. He entrusted his daughter to one of his most trusted advisers as he had stayed behind and supposedly perished in the ruins along with his beloved wife Finathia. They both had managed to make it out of the castle, but only because of an old friend who stayed behind and risked their life to allow both to escape. He then decided thereon that he would leave the future in the hands of youth. They could make a better future than he could ever attempt to create. ""I guess I can't hide the fact of my status."" He said casually still laughing surprised that the girl knew something about his heritage. He wouldn't ask how she knew since it didn't matter anymore. It was so long ago that even if were discovered he was Emperor Benign of the Valdaria Empire, it would still change nothing about the past. There was nothing to be changed from the past nor did he have any intention on dwelling on the past either.
""I shall inquire nothing more then."" He said dismissing himself from the girl as he turned around and headed back for his dragon. There was nothing more for him to ask and it wasn't like him to pry into other people's personal affairs. If they didn't want to tell him then they had their reasons and he respected that.
""Take care of yourself and try to exercise more caution."" </s>"
33,"<s>[INST] All of this talk about gods and justice is making me sick. Why won't people just leave me alone. Fenrir said, and growling and snarling to cast a spell at the girl with the electric knives. This spell targeted on [/INST] es very being and filled it with despair and misery. A normal person would be so overcome with grief that they would be basically immobilized as they are engulfed in darkness. The spell is know as Abyssal Despair. </s>"
34,"<s>[INST] Fenrir laid on the ground, it appeared as if he didn't have a scratch on him do his regenerative abilities and over-all tediousness, but that amount of regeneration take out all of his energy. He couldn't even get off the ground he was that exhausted. He started to just talk to himself in his no [/INST] rmal speaking voice, ""I was born only to fight, I was taught only how to fight, I was trained only how to fight, and I can't even fight. I am worthless."" he said in a broken and defeated tone. He then reached his hand out trying to stretch it out, revealing his Ragnanok Band as it lightly glowed. </s>"
35,"<s>[INST] Thank you for trusting in me. I'll do my best not to disappoint you, Fenrir. It was the first time she said his name casually where she turned her head at the rest of the group, ""Let's all regroup with the main unit now."" She smiled at Fenrir then noticed Nathan wanted to go. If what he said was accurate then they better make their way out of the capital and regroup with the rest of the group. Meira jumped onto her pegasus then told her purple haired friend that she was going to regroup with the others. It was time for her and everyone else to make their retreat from the capital before the soldiers arrived to block their advance. She immediately had her pegasus flaps its wings and off she went into the sky gliding toward the others. Ranathia turned her mount around digging into itself as she took off toward the gate finally passing it not taking long before she was into the forest.
Ranathia stopped for a moment remembering that Meira made a promise toward the werewolf. She was a bit hesitant to turn around and offer the werewolf a ride and the fact he was a male made her feel very uneasy. ""I just...."" She said stuttering at the thought of giving him a ride. Meira took notion toward the fact that she had still remembered her childhood friend Ranathia was till uneasy around men. Knowing that she turned her mount around in Fenrir's direction. She was a bit hesitant to give him a ride, but not because of Ranathia's reason, Rather. she was under the impression he did not like to ride on mounts and would rather keep on foot. Landing near him she offered him a ride on her mount, despite if he accepted or rejected her offer she immediately took off and caught up with the rest of the group before the main force assembled where they were at. Something must have happened inside the castle if it took them this long to respond and she thought it was probably something bad. She didn't know what it was, but she thought she had an idea. Before they get accused of being a part of the plot that happened in the castle which is stalling the guard, they best flee the capital which is what Ranathia and her.
Meira looked back at the capital sighing in relief as she rode on pegasus, ""It's finally over... Now we have to determine what our next action will be. If I'm to become a ruler then I'll need a place to defend where I base my strength off of. I'll think about that once I return to Windgrace where I can plan everything out accordingly."" She said as she continued to glide in the sky with her pegasus not taking long to regroup with Lenna, Azmaldus and Drausius units. Neither of the three asked any questions as they saw the others had caught up to them. They were just relieved to see they came back safely and that was all that counted.
Drausius listened to what Siia had just told him a moment ago though he wasn't sure how to put his words for it. She told him this before back at the Order and he thought she was insane, but there was starting to become truth which started to light up around her words. When Meira approached he inquired toward her which caught her by surprise at first, but then she realized that Siia is a visionary and that is probably how he knew, ""Princess Meira, what do you plan to do now? Surely you can't continue to sideline yourself and not act on your own gumption?"" Drausius questioned since he wasn't sure if Meira understood the consequences of war and he questioned if she had the power to lead an army herself. A title was just merely a status to announce someone so that other people who knew about the lineage knew who it was. It wasn't enough to convince the people's hearts of those who didn't know them that they were going to fight for what they wished for. Even though he did have his doubts, he would encourage her to rise to the throne. The people at times like this needed someone like her to keep th [/INST] eir hearts strong. Certainly Guardia and Rudoria at the current states they were in weren't going to accomplish that. He looked at her once again then continued with what he was going to say, ""You do realize, by rising to the throne you are no longer under Windgrace's protection? I won't stop you, but I will warn you princess that the road to sovereignty is a rugged and treacherous one. Be very careful in who you trust. That is all I can tell you for right now."" He warned her as he awaited her responses as she touched down on the ground with her pegasus so he could take with the Pangaea Order official. She brought her pegasus in for a landing as safe as possible trying not to run into the trees while bringing it down for a safe landing. Though the space was tight she managed to get it on the ground without any problems. She would need his assistance if she was to bring up her own nation and she was going to do her best in trying to persuade Drausius to see things her way. She wasn't going to overdo it with her statements trying to keep them self-explanatory as possible.
""I know you mean well at trying to persuade me to reconsider, Meister Drausius, but I made a promise which I cannot go back on. I promised I would create a world where everyone would be happy. I know you see that as nothing, but a child's fairytale. I believe I can make it happen. I appreciate your concern, but I assure you my friends will look out for me on my path to becoming Queen. I also know that my title is just a mere formality or status so people know who I am. I will show you that I have earned my title as a princess and that I was not made a princess merely by blood. It wasn't a birth right or blood right. I will do what I can to ensure that I am worthy of having that title and one day I will promote myself to queen when I feel I'm ready."" Meira said boldly in response to Drausius statements earlier. She knew he was trying to persuade her not to go through with what she was about to do, but she made a promise and she knew that a deal is a deal. She wasn't going to go back on her word. She'd be betraying her friends if she did. She was confident that she could do everything she said she could.
""Very well then, princess. The Pangaea Order will review your request and we will appoint you a land which will be yours and where you can start your quest toward power. Princess, I know you mean well and that you don't want to disappoint. I'm not saying you shouldn't take this path, but I will warn you that you should be very cautious when traveling the path. As Meister, you are under the protection of the Order, but I request that you return to Windgrace while we review your case. We will do our best to support your cause and fund your nation the best we can, but be truth about what you're going to do. That is all I ask. Don't disappoint those who put their faith into you. That is all I have to say, princess. May fortune be with you on your journey toward power. One last note, you'll need to announce to the Queen of Windgrace that you plan to live up your name. She needs to know that you wish to be a ruler. I'm sure she will do what she can to support you if she can. That is all I can do for you, princess.""
""You're so much like your mother, I can hardly tell you apart. Not by just looks. You act almost exactly like your mother did."" Drausius added as he finally let his voice fall silent where he looked at his wife and admired her. He knew one day Meira would have a companion to travel at her side to be with her for the rest of her life too. He just didn't know when.
Meira was shocked Drausius knew about her mother where she asked out of curiosity, ""YOU KNEW MY MOTHER!?""
Drausius shook his head shocked she didn't know where he said briefly, ""We can talk about that later. There will be plenty of time for words once we return to Windgrace."" </s>"

39,"<s>[INST] Inside the Windgracian castle, an audience between the queen of the country and various other figures including those who reigned from far away lands. Lands that were so far away that another nation stood in the way of a clear straight path toward reaching the Pangaea Order. A freshly set of beautiful cedar wooden like steps carried themselves all the way up to the queen's golden chair which was situated toward the back of the audience room. Off to her sides were two rooms, both of which had a guard placed in front of them to ensure that no one would enter without the queen's consent. One of those rooms was the queen's bedroom and the other was her royal office. In the queen's hand rested a golden staff that peered all the way down to the bottom of the surface of the floor which her feet were planted on. This staff was decorated with various ornaments such as beautiful sapphires, emeralds and rubies which show of the staff's beautiful glistening sparkle shine. Beside her is her adviser Siia dressed in her usual uncommon advanced women wardrobe like apparel that looks like it is sci-fish due to the strange texture in the material used. Like the queen, Siia also keeps her attention faced forward where three other figures accompanied by a group of mages stand in front of the queen.

The queen looked at her audience as her foot accidentally nudged the hilt of her rapier. The beautiful silverish luster from the blade gave off a glare from the lights of the chandelier. The beautifully forged blade was in its rightful sheathe that usually was fixed to her hip by attaching it to her belt. Her shield that lay on top of her sword lightly kissed with the side of her ankle. Both lie on the ground right in front of her feet as she kicked her foot back toward the leg of her regal chair. As she did so, the expression on the queen's face was one of complete confusion when the representatives from the Pangaea Order tried to explain to her that Meira had agreed to take her place on the throne.
The Windgracian Queen didn't know how to take the news of Meira wanting to take the throne. She wasn't about to stop Meira from rising to the throne, but she wasn't entirely sure she was completely ready to lead her own army. There was more to ruling than just leading an army and she wasn't entirely sure if Meira knew that. Also, the fact the princess tend to show a hothead toward those who upset her didn't help her case at all either. Even though the Queen did not agree with her decision she would honor it by allowing her coronation to take place in the castle. It was about time she returned what rightfully belonged to her anyway which was a tiara she received from Meira's mother Melianth. The queen was Meira's age when Melianth presented her with the tiara she wore when she used to be a princess of the Valdaria Empire which collapsed decades ago. The queen was hesitant to accept the tiara, but Melianth insisted saying that she didn't need it anymore. She had no intention in reviving her father's nation and she planned to help the world of Gaea without being restricted to a throne chair.
Focusing her attention on those who have appeared in front of her as representatives, she leaned forward in her throne chair. Even when she was leaning forward, the red cushion below her posterior served her a comfortable reminder of why she liked to sit in her chair. Brushing that thought aside she finally came to complete focus and stopped thinking about what was on her mind earlier. Even the fact she was concerned about Meira wanting to become a ruler didn't stop her from speaking her piece, ""I understand that Meira wishes to acknowledge her title as princess and be presented properly with a crowning, correct?"" She questioned trying to hide her worry within her plain voice which could be heard loud and clear in the room. As the two shuffled around earlier talking their piece as Siia just continued to observe the situation as the queen's adviser, the silver haired man named Drausius stepped forward signaling toward his wife to stay behind him. He didn't want to get his wife involved in his talk since she could be extreme at times and wish for things to die. That was something he knew the queen did not tolerate. With a serious plain voice as Azmaldus stood right behind him to back him up if necessary he plead toward the queen, ""Queen Erialyss Windgrace, daughter of Verbeina, I would not have called this audience if I was going to waste your time."" He took a momentary pause clearing his voice as he came off a bit scratchy. Erialyss didn't say a word knowing that he wasn't finished with what he was saying.
After he cleared his voice and accepting the glass of water offered by the queen's soldier who returned to their position he continued on with what he was about to say, ""Princess Meira of the former Valdaria Empire wishes to take up her family's name and help the people who are suffering in this land."" Once again he paused as he brought up his hands in a gesture of trying to persuade the queen to consider their offer. Sure, the Pangaea Order wasn't on the best of terms with Windgrace due to their involvement with Rudoria in the past, but that wasn't his fault he thought. He didn't agree to lend aid to the Rudoria Kingdom and the Oracles who control the main governing body had all sided with Ezmeralda at the time even though he didn't like their decision. The decision to use Ragnanite Demons further invoked his dislike for the main governing body. He needed to set things straight and try to repair relations with Windgrace. He was hoping to do that by helping Meira achieve her place in society. When she first asked him, he was quite surprised. To ask him out of the blue while mounted on his horse that she wanted to become a queen really arose some bewilderment that he tried not to let overwhelm him. He never thought a girl who wanted to be normal would suddenly change her heart so easily. It was surreal to the point he thought it was just a dream, but he realized that he was just trying to find a way to hide his embarrassment about being overtaken by the news earlier.
""Continue."" The queen requested as she had reached the point of his pauses were taking too long. Too long to the point it was trying at her patience which is something he did not wish to do so he continued with what he had to say knowing full well the queen didn't have all day to listen to him babble. He focused his attention mainly on Erialyss once again continuing with what he was going to tell her, ""So, I Meister Drausius, have agreed to help her achieve her place on the throne. We will need to hold an official coronation ceremony crowning the princess properly and I know you out of all people my illustrious queen know that."" He once again paused but only for a moment. Knowing that it was a bad time to let himself get consumed into thought he continued once again, ""I know that Windgrace and the Order's relations aren't that great. After we aided in the invasions of the Anzier Empire which perpetuated its downfall and the Guardia Kingdom I can understand why Windgrace is cautious about receiving us. I am honored you'd at least allow us to present our case, your majesty."" He bowed toward the queen trying to make an impression to help broaden the hopes of restored relations. He knew that a simple bow wasn't enough to restore the lost trust, but it would be a start as he tried to honor the queen with flattery.
""Your flattery knows no bounds and won't sw [/INST] ay me so easily. I understand your position, Meister."" She paused as her voice became more intense and serious just by the adjustment of her tone. ""But understand that our people were stunned you would resort to dirty tactics like use demons for means of subjugation. While it wasn't your doing, it still doesn't excuse your nation for the blame. As for Meira's coronation, she can hold it inside the castle where I'll return this tiara that belongs to her."" Erialyss paused once again as she picked up the beautiful silver littered with diamonds and sapphires tiara which Meira's mother once wore. Sure she was hesitant to let the sentimental value of the tiara go, it didn't matter as she was going to return it to its proper owner. It wasn't hers to begin with even if it was a parting gift from her friend. ""I will allow the Pangaea Order to be present during the coronation, but I request they leave after it has concluded. That is all I have to say."" With that the queen finished talking and Drausius bowed toward the queen as did his wife Ishtora even though she was hesitant to do so. The guards were ordered to show both back to their quarters where she requested that Azmaldus stay behind for a moment. She had some pressing business to discuss with him.
""Very well."" Azmaldus said as he approached the queen's throne as the two soldiers beside her stepped away after she signaled it was all right.

Meira and Ranathia continued to sit on the couch while they relaxed in relief. The troubles they faced earlier in the Guardian nation had weighed heavily on their hearts. Some which sprang about mixed emotions about what had happened earlier. Both Meira and Ranathia both looked at each trying to find the words to express how they exactly felt about the chain of events that transpired in the Guardian capital Ereis Eisan. First they were meeting with the king as he had requested. After that some maniac of a woman made accusations which forced them to return to their native land. It was both confusing and frustrating for both girls as they tried to calm the pressure they felt from the anxiety of the situation earlier. They both wanted an explanation of why events happened like they did and thought Siia knew more about what was going on than she was telling them. It was to no surprise to either since it was typical of that cold woman to keep anyone in the dark. She always made them try to understand everything from themselves and always dogged the questions that only made both girls even more curious about the woman's actual motives.
""I just can't understand it all!"" Meira yelled as Ranathia nodded at her agreeing with her wholeheartedly. It made no sense to her either why they were treated as allies at first. Invited into the castle to meet with the king to only have their meeting take a turn for the worst accusing them of treason. They would curse the day that woman was born since she ruined their plan they presented to the queen. It made both think if the queen would lose faith in their abilities. Their plan they wanted to present to the king was pretty self-explanatory and any novice could easily put it into words that could be understand by all people. One which they put their utmost faith into only to have it backfire on them in the end. ""First we were treated as guests being summoned to the audience room. After a few change of events we then were treated like traitors. I had sworn my loyalty to Guardia and even the king heard my vow."" She said trying to restore the confidence she lost in herself earlier. While she didn't lose all her confidence since she did defeat Fenrir in a fight, she still was shaken up mentally over what had gone on earlier. Meira leaned herself forward as she sat on the couch as she tried to ponder the thoughts that still linger in her mind aimlessly.
There was plenty of time to contemplate with the luxury of being in her beautiful home which had various famous pieces that were works of art including the furniture and the couch she sat on was no exception. The brown tone on the wood you could see from the head to the arms of the couch glistened into the light a magnificent finish that was merely a masterpiece best served. The wood hugged the soft comfortable cushion layer of the couch which made it easy to make anyone relax. Off to her side was her fireplace which was dormant since it was still in the middle of the fall. She only used it when it was cold, but the orange flame that licked her smooth skin always gave her a warm and gentle feeling of comfort and security. The finely crafted chandeliers that hovered above their heads gave off a radiant glow which filled the entire room with its innocent shine. While her purple curtains warded off most of the light outside, a segment showered the ground with its luminance peering into the shadowy presence that tried to laminate the floor.
The sun outside shone its beautiful rays of light down upon the capital. Its brazen ocherous glare smiled upon the people with its tangerine luster. Most beautiful when veiled by the puffy white marshmallowy clouds transformed into a vermilion radiant shine which peered into the horizon below as it set into the oceanic sky above. During the time of dusk was the best time to visualize the elegant beauty the sun in the sky had to offer which was usually when Meira went outside just to watch be swallowed by the azureness of the sky above. She continued to wait for the time so she could reflect on the rest that had happened today which floated around in the back of her mind isolated by the troublesome thoughts of earlier. Trying to bring a smile onto her face and widening it she looked at Ranathia, ""I guess we'll have to wait and see what the queen says tomorrow."" She paused for a moment as she leaned back onto the couch while trying to brush away the annoying thought about having to attend a coronation, ""Probably during my coronation."" She said with some frustration in her voice. It wasn't the fact she had to wear a dress that bothered; moreover, she really disliked hanging around a bunch of people who were twice her age. She didn't see how Erialyss found that any fun either.
The whole time Meira had spoken Ranathia had remained silent not saying a single word. She listened in with her attention on Meira whenever she did talk. When she overheard her complaining about her coronation. She understand and wasn't entirely thrilled about it either since she always felt naked without her sword. She never liked wearing a dress and it was always so stuffy in the castle, because a lot of people were invited for special events. Though something struck her curiosity about who would all be invited to her coronation. One of the people that troubled her the most when she thought about that was Fenrir. Unlike Meira even if he agreed to swear himself to her cause, she wasn't entirely convinced he could be trusted. He attacked a Guardian citizen over something totally trivial and thought the princess was being a little too generous about what she was doing. The fact he wandered the streets of the capital even caused her to become a little bit more tense. She took a deep breath and let off a deep sigh which alarmed Meira. Ranathia shook her head letting Meira know it was nothing to concern herself with. </s>"

Craning her head, Whizzle saw a tuft of pink hair going into the room that was previously barricaded on the other side of the room. Curious, she put the book she was reading back into the shelf it came from before walking to the door. She tilted a head, picking between entering the room or staying out. Before she could do so, she then heard Meira shouting to someone from inside the room. Whizzle raised an eyebrow, the yell can't be directed at her since she was outside so, it meant someone else had sneaked in, maybe even before her. Picking her decision, Whizzle peeked into room.

Alice walked [/INST] out to the Market District's street, she only got several steps out when a shadow loomed over her and the resulting collision knocked her off her feet. She was bumped hard enough that the girl was thrown into another passerby, a scrawny looking boy with permanent scowl on his face.
""Hey, watch where you're walking, human!"" the figure shouted at her. Alice glared at the bulldog Nekrian looming over her, who ignored it and chose to look at the boy that Alice was thrown to. ""Hah, pathetic, a little bump and you need another person to hold you? A scrawny looking person that is closer to bones than the meatbags you humans are and can't even do it properly?"" </s>"
41,"<s>[INST] Azmaldus expected a confused response from Nathan. It seems his father died before he ever got the chance to properly introduce him to Nathan. Azmaldus remembers the child that Ysolde held in her hands during the time he visited. Though he was a bit taken back why he shortened his name to Nathan since the name that was given to him was longer. Then it hit Azmaldus that he probably didn't like that name. If he didn't like that name then he would respect that fact and just call him Nathan. Though abandoning your real name isn't one of the most respectable things you can do for your family. He wanted to tell Nathan that he should honor his parents and go by his real name, but he refrained from doing so seeing as it was none of his business. When Nathan offered him a seat he took one sitting across from Nathan on a sturdy stool Nathan took from his kitchen. He shook his head toward Nathan telling something that might surprise him completely, ""You see Nathan, your father Nozdormu and i were old friends. Hah,"" He laughed a little as he thought Nathan was being silly about what he said, ""When I used to be a ruler which was years ago, I hired your father to do missions for me. I heard about his fame and how he was a famous dragonslayer which attracted my attention. That is when I sent an emissary of mine to recruit him telling him I'd pay him any price he asked for. That is how I got to know him. It's also how your father met your mother. Your mother was a priestess for the church inside my castle back then.""
He paused for a moment to rest his breath for a moment. He remembered the times he spent with both Nathan's mother and father. Those were times he enjoyed the most since they were the happiest times he had with his wife Finathia. Thinking about the past made him thin [/INST] k about Finathia and how he missed his deceased wife. Even though he wanted to join her in death, he made a promise that he would watch over Melianth and be there for her when she grew up. He was surprised someone as old as him managed to survive the turbulent times of his daughter. Over those times he suffered casualties in his family losing not only his wife, but also his only son and his eldest daughter Valeria. These are people that Meira never got the chance to know. He still remembers when she was an infant that she asked him about those people. She was always a curious girl is what Azmaldus always remembered.
""I owe your father my life. He is one of the reasons I'm still around today."" He laughed as he remembered when Nozdormu convinced Azmaldus who was being stubborn and wanted to stay behind in the castle. Back then he didn't want to leave his wife or let her die alone and still he couldn't avoid having her die alone. Sometimes he kicked himself over that and at first he was angry with Nozdormu for saving him. He did thank Nozdormu and his fiance at the time Ysolde when they helped his two daughters escape from the castle. He didn't understand why Melianth and Valeria back then would do something as foolish to try to resurrect their own brother. He was a fool to ignore Ysolde's warning about how his two daughters were performing forbidden arts. He did apologize to Ysolde later for how he treated her when she told him about the two.
Brushing his many thoughts aside he looked at Nathan and continued to pause his discussion to give Nathan a chance to respond to what he had just said. He would provide Nathan with what was given to him that was from bother his parents once he got to that part. For now he held onto the keepsakes until the time presented itself. </s>"
42,"<s>[INST] While Meira laid on the ground unconscious Whizzle had called out to the intruder in the room. Unfortunately for him, the intruder was long gone leaving no traces of their remains when they vanished into thin air. Apparently from the materials laid on the desk, the intruder was looking into the book that was given to Rana by the mysterious woman known as Siia. The book had a brown cover and the text was golden yellow in color. Now the book wasn't on the table. Instead it is now in the hands of Whizzle who decided to take the forbidden tome with them. On the floor Meira lays unconscious as all the strange glyphs and marks on her body vanish back into her body. The episode she was having earlier had been averted thanks to Whizzle's magic.
Deep inside Meira's consciousness she sees herself in some strange building that has glyphs and runes all over it. She has no idea where she is at and begins to panic. The only thing that she remembers is that she blacked out and that is when her mind went completely blank. Meira couldn't at all remember anything about what happened before she blacked out. It was as if the memory had been completely wiped from her mind. She saw cobblestone stairs in front of her that carried themselves upward toward a throne like chair that was situated in the back. She picked herself off the ground then freaked out when she saw she was wearing a kimono. She demanded to know where her clothing went and a voice told her to settle down. That this was all going on in her subconscious and that she was still wearing her normal clothes. The kimono she was wearing was pinkish purple with all kinds of flowery designs and embroidery that stretched all across it.
Meira made her way up toward the top of the steps of the building she was in. At the top she saw a pink haired girl with one eye that was blue and another which was bright red. It was unusual to see a girl with two different colored eyes. She doesn't remember anyone that had such eyes other than a mythological race that were called the Kheminians. The girl wore strange clothing which she had never laid her eyes on before. She wore a white short dress with a cape that stretched down to her ankles. On her arms she wore sleeves that stretched out a bit bulky where the arm was near the shoulder, but became more thin as it made its way toward her wrists. Over top those sleeves she wore a long golden armlet that went almost back toward her elbow. Underneath her outfit with several slits in it was a one piece like spandex bodysuit that was trimmed in the form of a swimsuit. She adorned on her breasts a golden breastplate. On her hip were golden hip guards that overlay her angelic white skirt.
""Who are you?"" She questioned toward the girl sitting in the throne like chair as she reached the top. Meira wasn't entirely sure what to think since when she reached the top it was like she was staring into a night sky. There were stars all over that clustered around the girl as she stayed relaxed in her chair. It was a sight which Meira had never seen before in her life. How did a dwelling like this house celestial bodies? Just what was this place and where was she? She felt like it was a dream, but when she pinched herself she only said ouch.
That made the girl giggle who leaned forward in her chair. She smiled toward Meira as she stood up from her chair and approached the pink haired girl. Meira was cautious and backed away. This only caused the girl to shake her head and tell Meira that she wasn't going to bite her. She continuously smiled at Meira with cheerful attitude, ""I'm sorry, didn't mean to startle you. I should have introduced myself. My name is Selest Lumina von Rosenau. You're a Sindel child, aren't you?""
Meira started out her introduction while greeting her properly first, ""Nice to meet you, Selest. The name is.."" But when she tried to say her na [/INST] me Selest had interrupted her with, ""Meira Rystaliuskal, correct?"" Selest smiled toward Meira as she stopped a few inches away from the girl. She then extended her arm to shake Meira's hand. This caused Meira to back up since she was shocked. She thought to herself for a moment as she tried to keep herself from being overwhelmed. How did she know... How did she know my name!? And what did she mean by Sindel child!? Me!? SINDEL!? WHAT!!!
""Calm your thoughts Meira. Just relax, you're letting yourself get flustered for nothing. I know all this is hard to believe or understand, but in time you will understand the purpose of your family's lineage. You are one of the last Sindel children in existence. We, the Kheminian or the overseers of your Universe, have been following the Sindel closely and their activities. I can't tell you exactly why you are one of the last in existence, but I can say that Gaea does have the answers. You are a Sindel that was born from the Exrius family making you a direct descendant of Elder Alkmaar. Listen to me closely, Meira. Don't be alarmed and don't get scared either. There is nothing scary about who you are. Let me show your something."" She paused as she approached Meira pressing her palm against her chest and held out her other arm to reveal a celestial blue orb in her body that had a dark purple crystal that revolved around in it. Meira didn't know what that thing was, but why was it in her body? That was the only question she could ask herself right now.
Selest then continued to ease Meira's confusion over seeing an orb being drawn out of her body, ""This orb signifies you as a true member of the Exrius family. The Exrius and Ciela members were all descendants of Alkmaar. I can't tell you the name of this orb or its purpose. I can't even tell you what this orb is either. I can tell you that this orb is special. This orb was passed down through the Exrius family generations. Don't be afraid of it. This orb is a personification of your other self Meira. If you are afraid then it will be afraid and start to get defensive."" Meira didn't know what Selest meant by 'other self'. She wanted to know more about the special object, but she knew Selest would only tell her what she needed to know. It still didn't stop her from almost going insane from not knowing anything more about this special thing she had in her body.
Selest removed her palm from Meira's body where the orb that was in the cup of the palm of her other hand went back into Meira's body. She then smiled once again as she told Meira to follow her where she lead them both to a room with cushions. ""Have a seat. I need to show you how to generate this new energy source that will empower your magic. You can't use Esir and Ragna energies anymore, Meira. Now you must learn to harness the Sindel long lost ancient technology called Elan."" Meira interrupted with a look of surprise all over her face as she shouted at Selest rudely who didn't look upset at all as her reaction was natural, ""ELAN!? What do you mean by that!?""
""Calm down Meira. Have a seat with me."" She said as she paused sitting down where Meira decided to do the same. Meira wasn't entirely sure what the point of this was, but if it was important she was willing to listen. ""Now listen with your mind for the vibrations in the air. Can you sense it?"" She asked seeing if Meira could detect the essence of Elan in the air. Meira shook her head since she didn't feel anything. All she could hear was Selest's voice and the quietness of the room. ""Don't listen with your ears, Meira. Listen with your mind and feel the sensitivity of the Elan particles in the air. Open your Synchrons in your body and feel the Elan with those. You can't feel Elan with normal senses so that is why you're having difficulty detecting it. It's a special essence that can only be detected via special means."" </s>"

The girl stuttered, unable to think of any response as Rhadamanthus turned to address his subordinated before talking to the werewolf. She took a sharp bre [/INST] ath before the Mahzok faced her again, arm extended in front of her. ""I..I'll come with you,"" she quickly answered, taking the arm and standing up. Following the older man, Alice occasionally looked back, worried that the werewolf followed after them. </s>"
44,"<s>[INST] I can feel them now. Meira answered Selest as she concentrated hard to sense the eluding Elan particles that filled the air. Meira could feel a tingling situation all over her body as the particles nudge her entire body as she drew them in. She could feel their power inside her body even if the particles weren't drawn into her body yet. She then felt a more sensitive tingle toward her body in which she could feel the particles entering and exiting her body. The particles had a certain gentleness to them which made her feel at ease as she continued to conjure them into and out of her body. Meira opened her eyes as she realized she had finally done it. That she had finally succeeded in detecting the Elan particles in the air of the unknown location she was still at. She stood up from her pillow and jump in excitement as she exclaimed in joy, ""I finally did it, Selest! I finally was able to feel them!:""
""Great job."" Selest praised her as she rose to her two feet and patted her on the shoulder. Selest was very proud of Meira since she had finally unlocked her ability to use Elan. This new special hidden power inside of Meira would take her magic to even further heights which Selest knew. Selest knew it was about time for Meira to return to where she came from. She walked over and embraced Meira tight with her body gesturing a farewell to her. Meira shook her head and didn't want to say farewell yet, but Selest insisted that she needed to go now. She felt her first day training was complete and they'd continue her training at another time. Before she sent Meira on her way, she showed Meira a special orb inside her body. When Meira tried to speak out of shock she held her index finger to her lips silencing her. Shaking her head she told [/INST] Meira in time she would learn what that orb was as she returned the orb she extracted from Meira's body back into her body.
Selest told Meira to close her eyes and when she did, Meira's entire mind went blank with darkness. She continued to toss and turn on the ground from the dream she was having until she slowly opened her eyes. When her eyes began to open, the room become more in focus as it became even more visual to her. She turned her head left and right to look around only to notice she was on a cold solid floor. She looked to see if she still had on the kimono only to notice that she was wearing her original clothes again. She stood up still resting on the ground as she questioned in the room, ""Ooohhh... Why does my head feel so out of place?"" She moaned for a moment as she tried to shake off the groggy feeling she felt. She would then continue as that feeling left her, ""Where am I and what am I doing on this floor?"" Meira said as she finally became alert after her dream had ended. She had no idea how long she had been out for and she knew the floor was certainly cold, hard an very uncomfortable. She remembered fragments of her dream though it all seemed so scrambled in her mind.
Meanwhile Ranathia was busy cooking the two a meal on the stove. She was about to adjust the temperatures when she heard a knock at the door. She told her maid to look after the food while she went to the door. The maid offered to answer the door, but Ranathia refused.It didn't take long for Ranathia to reach the door where she opened it and saw Fenrir standing outside which caught her by surprise.

He threatened as he walked away with the book in his hands and put the ring away in one of his pouches. He was rather aggravated about being used by this woman to do her dirty work. He had also lost all respect for his former friend Aodeos, if you could even call him a friend anymore. What surprised Luther the most is that he didn't know that someone like Aodeos could stoop so low as to use leverage against people.
""Hmmm..."" Aodeos turned his attention toward the roof interested then noticed four females that were trying to stay secluded from sight. He started to grin as he recognized all four of them and knew who exactly these girls worked for. Not only that, he also knew what they were exactly up to. ""It's not nice to eavesdrop, ladies. Why don't you come down here and introduce yourselves to us?"" He said toward them as they finally stood up and decided it was time to show themselves. They knew soon enough that someone as intelligent and aware as Aodeos would eventually sense them. He then began to speak to the four ladies as they all moved close to him after jumping down from the roof to the surface. But before he began he motioned toward Duress, ""I think the girl would be safer in Malice's hands. After all, this is her show and I'm only the host."" Right after he finished that first statement Duress pushed the restrained girl over toward Malice.
""Well ladies, why don't you all introduce yourselves to us?"" He pulled up his disguise enough so you could see his lips and him beginning to smirk. Not much was visible and you really couldn't get any real idea of what he looked like since all of his skin was covered in black robes. The three women were not amused by his antics and their eyes became a bit more fierce when he thought they would find him amusing at all. When they refused to introduce themselves he decided to introduce the four instead. ""The first pink haired girl in the skirt is the beautiful Princess of the former Valdaria Empire Mistress Melianth Rystaliuskal. Beside her is the other pink haired girl who is the unbelievable daughter of Melianth's deceased sister Valeria whom people thought didn't have one and also has the same father as Melianth's daughter Meira, Reala Valdaria. Then we have the silver haired maiden Miiarvanthalu Vanb'Rianthei who is the sister of the mysterious fourth girl Siianthaliae Axthrusia Vanb'Rianthei. I never thought I'd meet the two famous Sisters of Chaos who helped bring an end to the Great Elian War many years ago. It's truly an honor.""
'Shut up."" One of the girl's remarked not at all amused by the comments made by Aodeos. The girl's then drew their weapons and looked like they were about to enter combat when Aodeos shook his head. ""I think it's time you girls cooled your hot heads before someone gets hurt."" He said amused as he pointed in the direction of Malice's new captive Chloris. ""You wouldn't want anything bad to happen to her, now would you? Don't worry, you'll get your fight, but you'll have to be patient and wait like good behaved women.""
""Take the girl inside, Malice. We will handle this. They'll play nice as long as they know you have the girl and if they make any move I'll warn you. After that, take her with you and do what ever you please with her."" He spoke toward Malice as the four girls didn't take any steps forward or try anything heroic. Even the slightest mistake they knew could wind up getting Chloris hurt or even killed at worst. They knew that Luther would [/INST] dread that day if it came and wouldn't cease until he was dead and joined her or until the one who took the essence from her life was dead.

""You may rise."" Erialyss said toward Alexander. She didn't want him to think that he had to stay on his knees all the time since he wasn't one of her servants. It was respectable to honor and dignify those who were royalty, but one didn't need to feel the burden to humiliate themselves in order to achieve that. ""I will also hold you to your word. As the Queen, I must say I'm honored to meet you and that now we are working in collaboration toward a resolution which will bring an end to this silly war between Guardia and Rudoria. The Guardian-Rudorian War must be stopped, but I cannot get involved or that will tarnish the neutrality and reputation of the Kingdom of Windgrace; however, if Meira were to rise to the throne and assume her status it would help us to ally with her and provide her with aid. I know it sounds like we are using her social status to our own salvation, but we really aren't. Though you may take that way if you wish. Do you have anything else to inquire from me, Sir Alexander? That is before I retire to my bedroom?"" Erialyss queried since she didn't want to dismiss himself without answering all the questions he might have and do her best to give him the answers he was looking for if she could. It was the least she could do for his Order when he traveled so far to get to her location. The fact the Order he came from and her were close was enough reason for her to put her faith and trust into him. She knew that he wouldn't disappoint her.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Meira's hands were covered in blood that she gotten from her grandfather's clothes and the wound which was still bleeding badly. She didn't understand why he didn't at least let her treat it, but when he asked her to return home she refused at first. Telling her not to worry and that he would live to see her coronated before he died she made him promise her. After she made him make that promise toward her she got up from the seat she was sitting on and left the park. She wasn't in the mood for any of the sights and started on her way back to the manor. She took his sword with her which she gripped tight with her hand despite them being covered in his blood. If anyone saw her they'd ask her how her hands got bloody. She needed to hurry back as quickly as possible and try not to alert Ranathia that there was trouble she ran into earlier. She began walking steady but fast down the sidewalk as she passed by the sights she enjoyed earlier, but now was ignoring. ""Why..."" She said under her breath as she continued to walk in the direction of her manor.

Luther had finally reached an area where the ring was really starting to resonate. He then gracefully trying to hide there was trouble by the face he hid under walked toward the door of the place that the ring was resonating to. He was reluctant to knock on the door since he knew he would be leading this boy right into a trap. A trap set by that devious woman, but if he did not obey harm would come to Chloris. Despite his resistance to knock on the door he did so and called out to the person living there, ""Nathan, it's Luther and I know it's strange I come here and impose on you, but it's urgent. Someone's life is on the line and I must speak with you immediately."" He said as he knew how pathetic his words sounded. He hated getting other people involved in his own problems, but this time there was no alternative. He noticed the person who lived here was probably a poverty stricken child since the shack was all run-down and only someone who hardly had any money would live in such a dump. ""I'll repay you after you help me rescue her."" </s>"
47,"<s>[INST] Take a look at this then. Luther revealed toward Nathan a ring that the woman had given him earlier showing it to him closely. ""All I know is that she gave me this ring and wants you to come. This ring is how i found you."" He paused momentarily showing Nathan more closely and allowing him to examine the ring before he decided to put it away. He couldn't give Nathan the ring yet. Not until Chloris was safe, but for now he'd hold onto it until they returned.
""Anyway, She said it had to be me and she has taken Chloris hostage so the only one who I could naturally ask for help is you. It's most likely a trap so we better prepare ourselves for the worst."" He said as he tried to persuade Nathan to come with him. If he wouldn't do it for his reasons then perhaps the ring would give him a better reason to go with him. Luther knew it was a trap and was very aware that the woman who was holding his girlfriend hostage was not someone that you should underestimate. If she worked with Aodeos then she was probably just as dangerous as his old friend was. ""Look, the woman who is holding her captor said it had to be you. She's forcing me to do her own dirty work only, because she's working with a snake like Aodeos. I'll explain the rest later. We must hurry!"" Luther explained as he started to walk back in the direction of where he had come from earlier.
He wasn't going to completely take the same root back. In fact, he had a plan though he didn't want to say anything about it yet. He decided on parts of the route where he could actually take detours that would lead him to the back of the house could play a strategical advantage. If they could get behind the people who were causing problem then perhaps they could turn the tables and free Chloris in the process without having to give them anything in return.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Chloris followed the woman willingly into the house though she tried to reach toward her side to grab her father's dagger which was hidden. There was a special pouch that was built into her clothes that was able to hold it in case she got into these kind of predicaments. Her hands started to move slowly toward the pouch so she didn't arouse any suspicion toward the woman that she was up to something. If she could get the dagger then she could work on cutting her wrists free. Slowly making her hands toward the pouch she flipped it open and pulled out a slender short bladed small dagger which she took into her hands. She slowly and gently without alerting the woman she was up to something started to cut away at the ropes with its very sharp blade.
""Lady Siia, it's been a long time since we last confronted each other."" The sneer that beamed up across his face was enough to invoke the flames of enmity and discomfort for the other girls. They really did not like Aodeos, but they knew how very dangerous he was along with those who were affiliated with his cult. Aodeos was one of the most powerful cult leaders in existence though Siia knew he erased his very existence from records by using time jumping. An effective method toward avoiding detection on the chronological scale and making it completely look like you're nonexistent. It was a strategy that Siia had employed in the past to win the various wars she war when she used to be a strategist and advisor. It was really unknown why she was with three other women, but it was obvious they were all there for one reason and that was the AoD Cult leader. Siia ignored Aodeos humor where she brought herself to say to him while remaining calm and composed, ""I don't really care about our past meetings.They only thing that is important to me at the moment is making sure you stop breathing. Until you do, I'll never be satisfied.""
""Such vulga [/INST] r words from a heartless woman."" Those words were enough for him to crack another grin at her which in return caused her face only to glower. This brought amusement toward Aodeos since he enjoyed to watch the heartless ice queen frown at him. He was very much turned on by her icy cold gazes that laser beamed across the room and the frigid smiles that could freeze like a Medusa. Her words were so forceful and passionate that it brought glee toward his humiliation he brought upon her.
The pink haired girl wearing the skirt had a more serious look embracing her face and her eyes burning with the flames of indignation. He knew all too well about her painful lightning she wanted to bring force in brute force and punish those who dare use others like they were pawns, especially to force leverage upon others who they could forcefully use as servants holding leverage on them all the while. ""You might think this is funny now, but you won't be laughing when we are done with you!"" Melianth exclaimed as she drew her two swords into her and prepared herself to combat these people.
The silver haired maiden turned her attention toward the other pink haired girl ordering her to follow the woman who walked off with the hostage. ""Reala, pursue that reprehensible woman. Siia and I will hold the front from here. You must go right after that woman, because the girl she has in her clutches might be in real danger."" Miia alerted Reala as the other three women were going to stay behind to deal with Aodeos and his cronies. Miia had heard about the history of that woman before and leaving that girl in her hands was really a bad idea. Since the girl was restrained that made it easier for that loathsome woman to control the situation. If they could surprise her from behind then perhaps they could make everything more favorable for them.
""I'm on it!"" Reala remarked as she jumped up on the roof and when Aodeos ordered his men to stop her that is when Melianth barred their path allowing her clear path toward getting to the back of the house. Reala made her way swiftly but with complete stealth toward the other side of the house while the other three battled Aodeos and his men. She was a bit worried about Melianth, but when she looked back she saw her wink at her which only made Reala nod and stay on task.
Siia and Miia both stood right in front of Aodeos while Melianth confronted the member of his Ten Gods Wisemen Duress. Siia and Miia had rather very serious expressions on their face where Aodeos remained calm as ever. He didn't even flinch nor did he show any sign of fear or discomfort. He grinned at the thought of having to face two of what he thought were the most beautiful women he had ever seen. Miia had a beautiful personality while her sister Siia had all the looks and was more beautiful on the outside than Miia. ""I must say, it's truly an honor to get to face the two Chaos Sisters."" He remarked with a sneer that widened on his face as he drew his scythe chain hook into his hand.
Duress had a very calm and composed look on their face too. They weren't at all taken back by the one many called the Holy Knight of Elia. They knew there were a lot of people out there who both loved and hated this person. Duress wasn't really a fan of them, but this was a challenge that was worthy of his recognition. Someone who would test Duress skill and make him have to utilize all his abilities to win. ""So you're Meira's mother?""
""Meira's mother? Who is Meira?"" Melianth questioned not having any idea who that was and when she was distracted by that is when Duress attacked and managed to knock her off her feet, but when he tried to follow up she recovered where he stared at her with a smug look on his face. ""Rule number one, don't become distracted. The fact I distracted you with that statement was enough for you to let down your guard."" </s>"
48,"<s>[INST] Whizzle leaned on the railing of the building's second floor thinking where he should go after safely getting away from the hazard library, the borrowed tome balanced on the top of his head as he looked [/INST] downward and saw Meira marching with a bloodied sword and hands. She looked upset, which he took as an invitation.
""Oh, that's a familiar looking sword, did you partake in a pre-dinner robbing?"" he said. </s>"
49,"<s>[INST] Chloris looks over toward a corner and notices a pink haired girl in hiding. She signals toward Chloris to duck when she tells her and cover her ears, because she holds a crimson ball in her hand which she is about to deliver to the ground with massive force. Right before she gets the signal she tries to warn Luther with her eyes about what is going to happen. Just at that time she manages to cut the ropes away on her chest as they fall to the ground where she is completely free. The only thing left is to remove the gag between her lips, but she can't do that yet without Malice suspecting something. Right when that happens she sees Reala deliver the ball created to the ground with massive force where she exclaims, ""Howl like a banshee and impair their hearing! WIND HOWLER!""
A small crimson ball of energy not meant to harm is delivered into th [/INST] e ground which screams and shrieks loudly like the deadly howling winds of a hurricane as Chloris finally plugs her ears then tilts her head back and butts Malice in the face then runs over toward where Luther is. Luther manages to plug his ears too as the sound is so violently that it can easily cause damage to the eardrum if a target listens to it for too long. Luther looks over toward Chloris as he grabs her asking if she is all right where she nods at him. She then grabs her sword which they stuck in a corner into her hand and stands with Luther and Nathan as Reala moves in position to block the front entrance toward the door outside. While she guards the entrance, Chloris is finally scene pulling her gag out of her mouth where it hangs around her neck like a necklace. She is relieved that everyone managed to get out of that in one piece. </s>"
50,"<s>[INST] I'm seriously not in the mood right now, Meira glowered. ""Are you here to annoy me now? Right now I don't have time to bother with idle jokes. I must return to the manor and rest my head for a bit so if you don't have anything important to say then I'll be on my way."" Whizzle raised his eyebrows and started to chuckle, even as Meria continued. ""Also, this sword belongs to my mother's father and no I didn't steal it from him! Do you take me for a hooligan? Don't compare me to you! He's... he's... he's..."" She started yelling. ""Nevermind, it's not important!""
It was at this point that Whizzle laughed, causing the tome on his head to fall down to the floor before he caught it. ""Aww, how can you tell me [/INST] that what I'm doing is not important when you yourself can't decide what is? Oh, maybe you're that sort of person that thinks everything and everyone not me are not important now? And how am I comparing you? I've always thought the only person you can compare yourself with is yourself,"" he said before faking a face of realization. ""Ah, maybe you are comparing yourselves! Well, that's a bout of self-depreciation then, calling yourself a hooligan like that. Can't say that there wasn't a reason for it but hey, since I'm you, I should be able to remember it. Let's see...""
Whizzle focused on Meira and concentrated as he proceeded in trying to pry open Meira's head and read her memories and thought.
---- </s>"
51,"<s>[INST] Whizzle blinked to the girl that floated in front of him. He took a glance at Meira's direction, who had apparently slipped back inside. With a shrug, he returned his attention to the sole other person nearby that he could talk with.
""Mo? Moneybag? If that is [/INST] what you think of your friend, you have an issue,"" he replied flatly before trying to read Selest's mind as well. Although his attempt now was more of a playful pokes to test her defenses. ""Besides, it just shows she needed more training in this department."" </s>"
52,"<s>[INST] At the time of the explosion, the three other girls had taken their fight up into the sky completely evading the explosion that occurred earlier. They didn't even notice that Chloris had been rescued at the time which was who Luther and Reala were both holding back from foolishly attacking the dangerous man Miia and Siia were both facing off against.le Earlier it was revealed by her that he had murdered her parents, a fact that the two girls going up against him aren't aware of yet. Melianth is parallel from the two girls taking on Duress by herself. The fact Siia and Miia facing Aodeos make look like he has the disadvantage, but so far he has been able to hold his own in the fight. He has yet to display any weakness toward the two sisters who have been trying to figure him out to avoid his trickery.
Melianth on the other hand is trying to determine a way to get close to damage Duress without having to leave herself wide open for a counter. She noticed when she tried to use Endless Massacre of Double Slashes which were lightning fast sword strikes that Duress manage to avoid them all that speed alone wasn't enough to defeat Duress. If she were to get a decisive strike she would have to find a way to get Duress to drop her guard or try to force her to get aggressive. The problem was Duress was a defensive type fighter and wouldn't attack unless you attack her first. This made it even more difficult to figure out a way to get around her defense.
Generating energy into her sword Melianth heads toward the ground which confuses Duress. Duress doesn't quite know why Melianth went toward the ground where they followed, but when she touched the ground that is when Melianth went on the offensive. Melianth took her sword and slashed out twelve earth burrowing swordwaves that moved in all directions in order to surround Duress making escape difficult. ""Interesting."" Duress said impressed as she noticed Melianth manage [/INST] d to force Duress to start getting offensive due to the change in her strategy. Duress swung her chain-link sword around striking all of the earth burrowing shockwaves, but Melianth caused them to disappear when she thrust her sword into the ground deep. Duress didn't quite know what Melianth was up to. The fact she made the waves disappear caught Duress by surprise. She didn't know if the attack was just a ruse or if she was up to something. Melianth's sword was stuck in the ground which was a golden opportunity to attack her.
""I don't know what you're trying to pull, but now your guard is down!"" Duress yelled as she made for a straight toward Melianth. Melianth didn't move at all while he was coming straight at her. She was anticipating this where she waited patiently for what she was about to do. When Duress tried to strike Melianth she immediately let huh slip out of her mouth when Melianth did a backflip backward. ""I won't miss twice!"" Duress yelled as she tried to wrap Melianth up with her chain-link only to have her vanish in thin air. ""What kind of trickery is this?"" She questioned to notice that Melianth extracted her sword and had said the words Requiem Force Reverse Parallel. Duress grinned knowing full well where the attack was coming from when she saw the swordwaves coming at her. She jumped into the air and her eyes became big when Melianth grinned the words 'got you' is when she was hit with a barrage of them. Her attack exploded which sent Duress sailing toward the ground after the explosion cleared sending her right into the house that was still standing just barely.
Miia pulled out one of her Elan bomb when Aodeos managed to knock Siia off balance throwing it right behind him. Aodeos didn't even see the attack coming where she detonated it which knocked him backward hitherto he used the energy from his aura to recover. Miia asked Siia if she was okay and she nodded at her that she was fine. </s>"
53,"<s>[INST] So...any chance you know something about this guy? Like how he fights or something? I really don't like to go into a fight blind, so any Intel would be really appreciated. Nathan said toward Reala as she tried to think closely about how Aodeos fought. She remembered her mother explained to her that Aodeos was both an offensive and defensive type of attacker who used strategy and planning to best hist targets with. Melianth warned her that he was very dangerous when on the defensive as he used people's attacks against increasing the power and damage that can be accumulated by them.
""Aodeos is a really hard to predict strategist that uses his own strategies to overwhelm his opponents with. Attacking him carelessly will cause him to stay defensive and if you leave an opening he'll take advantage of it meaning letting down your guard means he'll go on the offensive. So the type of attacker he is you can say [/INST] he's a strategist kind. Yes, he would send your attacks back at you, but with a catch. He absorbs your attack increases the power of it and returns it to you with even more destructive power than it originally had."" Reala revealed toward him as she saw Siia and Miia were still just standing there and that Aodeos wasn't taking any action at all either. The three looked serious though Aodeos a bit amused since that same grin he always wears is still implanted on his face. Duress just stares from below on the sidelines as she knows she is in no condition to be fighting anymore after taking damage from Melianth's attack.
""Ready whenever you are ladies."" Aodeos grinned at them as he also turned one blind eye to see Reala and Nathan had emerged from the structure that had been just destroyed. He remained on guard while he strategized once again to help him determine the right strategy for fighting these people. </s>"
54,"<s>[INST] Alexander saw Meira reach for her weapon, but stop. ""There is no need to violence. I just wish to speak to you."" he then walked inside as proper when he was invited in. ""Why, you act like you never heard of the Order of Paladins, we have been standing strong for generations, and I can also see you're a bit skeptical. I guess this is a bit unorthodox, trying to align with a kingdom that hasn't even been properly formed let. But, we do have our reasons [/INST] for such haste.
""Darkness is coming to Holyoke. I am not referring to the armies of Guardia and Rudoria, petty wars are bound to happen and normally sort themselves out. However, the Order has detected much eviler forces at work. Things of witchcraft, treason, and cults, and possibly things that not even I have been informed about, possibly even outside of the knowledge of my superiors. When the evil is at Holyoke's door, the Order plans to be ready."" </s>"
55,"<s>[INST] Hahahahah, you still don't get it, do you? The strange man grinned as he activated his glyph and detonated both glyphs into the sky. When the glyphs exploded they let black aura pour out of them as he continued to laugh letting the flames consume him. ""You managed to defeat my toy? How amusing. You put on enough of a show for me today. Besides, one death only means another born anew. I'll continue to be reborn until you figure out what is going on, ahahahah!"" Only problem was even when he had been consumed by the flames, he was still laughing. This was an indication to the group that the version of Aodeos they fought was a humuculus. Siia and Miia both were confused until it hit them about that technique he had used earlier. They noticed a slight difference in the one that he was about to use on Nathan. He never snapped his fingers when they attacked him with Sadistic Masochist which meant at that time he swapped places with a humuculus. They figured that out when he phrased 'one death only means another born anew' which indicated that that this Aodeos was a humuculus he created.
Miia and Siia both examined the area noticing [/INST] that there was no one else around other than Reala and Melianth who were on the ground. They turned their heads to notice that the girl Melianth fought earlier named Duress had disappeared. Both girls knew there was something strange about that Aodeos, because of the way it used its magic. Both knew Aodeos never snapped his fingers when using a spell or technique since he never needed to. Both thought to themselves while trying to collect the rest of their thoughts. So if this one is an obvious fake? Then where did the real one go? Something about that technique he used on us earlier doesn't add up. He never projected a portal behind him. Which means he switched himself out sometime before that attack took place. Meaning there's another person who is here that is unaccounted for. But who? They both question in their mind as they survey the area.
The sky starts to laugh as the voice fades away, ""I'll leave you all to try to figure out what just happened. But I know for a given fact that you'll never figure it out. Hope you had fun with my puppet. We shall meet again."" Those were Aodeos final words before the voice went silent. </s>"
56,"<s>[INST] Now that the fight was over, the four girls separated going their separate ways for now. Siia, who was the youngest of the group appearance wise, decided to head into the marketplace and pick up the bread she ordered. She didn't like the part of town she picked the bread up from, because it was known to have some really bad people at times. That part of town was known for the scum who liked to sexually harass women. When Siia went strolling by the group that earlier was flirting with girls and sexually harassing they decided to follow the pretty little teenage girl wearing an angelic white dress that flowed down toward her knees.
Siia walked over toward the place where she picked up her bread. Though when she got to the place she noticed the original clerk wasn't there. She was a bit curious why he wasn't there since everytime she picked up her bread he was there. She didn't really want to say anything to the smelly guy who she could smell from where she was, but she wanted her bread so she decided to approach him regardless of his pungent stench. The guy had a wide grin as he approached where he greeted her like any normal clerk, ""How may I be of service to you, missy?""
The fact the man just called her ""missy"" made her frown. Never has anyone called Siia ""missy' before and this was certainly a first. She was starting to suspect something fishy was going on, but unless in self-defense she wasn't allowed to utilize her magic. ""For one it's not ""missy"" and two I came here to pick up my order."" Siia sighed at the man bored by how he was trying to impede her by addressing her like what she would call a moron. She handed him the money anyway where he handed her the bread.
Little did she know that the man behind the counter had changed the price on the bread she bought. When she tried to walk away three other smelly individuals stopped her from leaving. The man at the counter was yelling at her as she turned her attention toward him. ""HEY, YOU BITCH! You think you can short change me and get away with it?""
Siia turned around while she placed her hand near her sword just in case the three hooligans behind her tried to creep up on her. She frowned where her a serious expression lit up on her face and her eyes became fiery when she looked at the fact someone had modified the price after she had left. ""WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL!"" Siia yelled at the man as her voice echoed in the vicinity. She knew the man had changed the price and that he wasn't the owner of the store. She was a bit curious how he was running the shop. Before she could ask he peered right into her ice with a sinister grin on his face, ""Why don't you just take off that dress and we'll call it even?""
Siia was enraged when he tried to get her to take off her dress. She knew the man was being a pervert. She couldn't do anything since they weren't doing anything illegal and if she drew her weapon she would be in the wrong. She thought dammit in her mind, because of the fact this man was playing her for a fool. The man became impatient where he signaled toward his men to surround the girl so she could not escape. ""I think I told you to take your dress off, so do it a [/INST] lready!"" This time he climbed over the counter and grabbed her arms suspending the above her head and pin them against a wall. ""Are we going to do this the easy way or do you want me to do this the hard way and get rough?""
""Get your hands off me, you pervert!"" Siia yelled as the man had her hands pinned up against a wall suspended above her head with one of his hands. He grinned as he sniffed around and enjoyed the essence that came off her. The man once again demanded, ""I'll let you go when you pay me the rest of what you owe. You can either give me your dress or I'll take the money out of you another way. So what is it going to be?"" His grin became even more wide since he would get his way either way. Siia was furious, but there was nothing she could do while she was in the position she was in. She couldn't even bring her leg up to kick him, because he pinned her against the wall tight.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
""If he wishes to speak to me alone then I will honor his request."" Meira said as she looked over toward Ranathia who was very upset and threw herself up from the table not liking how she had to trust this person she hardly knew. Though if that is what her liege desired she would honor her wish even if she didn't like it. She didn't want to do anything to displease the one she was meant to protect.
Meira felt a little guilty telling Ranathia to leave. She knew that Ranathia was very upset and that she was probably going to vent out her later for her decision, but this person might have valuable information. She knew Ranathia didn't trust anyone that she didn't know despite their social status, but knowing it was a knight from an order made Meira put her faith in him and listen to what he had to say. Perhaps she could learn something from all this.
Ranathia walked away from her seat with a very serious look on her face. She stopped for a moment in front of Alexander and placed her hand down near him as she faced to face to face. She intended to let him know how she felt about having to leave as she ordered her maid into the other room with her dish. ""If her highness wishes to speak to you alone I will honor her wishes, but I'm not doing this for you. Don't get any ideas that I am getting friendly with you, because I'm not. I don't know about this order or if you're a reputable knight nor do I care right now. I trust no stranger that waltzes in this house especially foreigners."" She paused for a moment as she drew her blade and let it rest on the table, Meira was about to object where Ranathia gave her a gesture that she wasn't going to do anything. Just let this person know that she wouldn't tolerate anyone using her liege for their ambition. ""I will warn you, if you are using or planning to bring harm to the princess I will cut you down where you stand without blinking an eye. Do I make myself, clear? Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go see if my informant has returned from Guardia."" Those were her final words as she sheathed her sword and walked away with a very disturbed and suspicious look that was on her face. </s>"
57,"<s>[INST] The words ""ah great"" were enough to disturb Selest's mind. She felt bad for coming uninvited due to the fact the boy inside sounded very tense for some reason. From the sound of it as Selest took into comprehension each word he spoke, it sounded like he wasn't having the best of days. She didn't know if she should introduce herself or leave. When she thought about leaving she shook her head saying to herself that would be rude. He did come all the way to greet her at the door though she was a bit nervous to actually meet with the man. His tone alone made her unsettling where it was hard to think and even more difficult for her to speak toward Nathan. He probably wanted to know how [/INST] she knew his name, but she knew even if she were to tell him that he wouldn't believe her anyway. Her mood shifted to an apologetic one once she learned that Nathan wasn't too happy about her presence.
""I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to disturb your peace. Perhaps I should come back another time."" She said in a troubled tone since it was obvious the girl was flustered about something. She didn't really make it clear what was bothering her, but judging by her body language and movements let alone the tone in her voice was enough to give hint that she was feeling very uneasy at the time.She tried to hide part of her face to prevent him from ever noticing and looked at him with one eye. </s>"
58,"<s>[INST] There's no need to apologize, because I completely understand. If it's all right with you then I think I'll come in. Selest responded as she nodded her head at Nathan feeling a bit more relaxed. This time she didn't feel much like a burden anymore. She saw there were no chairs so she concentrated her energy creating a magic glyph where her book started to glow and the symbol disintegrated into a very fancy looking chair which she used to take a seat in. ""I thank you for your hospitality. I'm a bit thirsty, think you could get me a glass of water?"" Selest asked as she situated herself so she was comfortable in the chair.
When she became comfortable she decided she would at least tell him who she was. It would probably just be better if she gave him her first name due to the fact he would ask questions she couldn't answer if she told him her last name. It was obvious earlier that Whizzle didn't believe her when she said her last name was Rosenau. Which was very true since Rosenau were the family who ruled over the Lumina Kingdom. However, she did take refuge in the Lumina Kingdom and was treated like a daughter of their own by the royal family when her mother passed away. ""I'm so sorry, I've been too caught up in thought that I forgot to tell you my name. My name is Selest. It's nice to meet you."" She smiled as she thought to herself from the images she saw. My, the pictures I saw of Nathan were no lie. He certainly was a strapping young lad back then. I can't believe that same man I saw from then was this dashing. It's truly amazing. I probably shouldn't meddle in the affairs of others while I'm in this realm since it might cause a paradox. She continued to think to herself that she should keep her visit strictly business and not fraternize with Nathan or it may cause a a problem with the space-ti [/INST] me continuum fabric which her mentor Siia had warned her about earlier. ""You're probably wondering why I'm here. I'm here with an important message and to prevent a disaster from happening. I know the preordained future that has been written as I can see the many possibilities of futures and know which ones will become reality in this realm. I know you probably don't believe me, but during the coronation a great catastrophe will befall many people who loved by many which will plant the seeds of war. Windgrace is in grave danger of entering into an all-out war with the entire world. We must prevent that from happening and that is why I'm here now. Someone within the Erewhon Pavilion wants revenge on the nobles of Windgrace and their plan is to cause a great tragedy which will erupt in a massive war which could destroy the Kingdom of Windgrace. There was also a resignation letter by the Queen, but it isn't signed by her.
The Queen in power right now is nothing more than a puppet queen. The real Queen went missing a long time ago, but the nobles tried to cover it up using a puppet queen. Other organizations are taking advantage of the opportunity by using the puppet queen to put into play their schemes. Stay close to Lady Meira and never leave her side. Someone this time is going to try to kill her this time. I don't know who but I pursued them once I learned they came back to this event to make sure she dies. The resignation by the Queen is a farce. It was signed by a fake queen and the coronation is just one huge death trap. If you don't believe me then ask Ranathia about the documents she has from the EP that one of her sources retrieved for her. The master scheme is inside there, but the one trying to cause Meira's death is not. I beg of you, please protect Meira. If she dies, all hope is lost."" </s>"
59,"<s>[INST] Huh, weirdo, Whizzle muttered as he watched Selest walked away. He then looked at the tome on his hand. ""Oh well....""
Whizzle scratched his chin before following suit and wandered toward the city to get some foods to accompany his reading. As much as the girls cooked for just the two of them and probably for their servants, Whizzle never liked carrying plates of food around, not to mention he probably should find something to carry the book with. It didn't take too long for him to get himself a sling bag that he used to put the book in and he walked around to find a food store. His legs stopped in front of a bakery and, after a moment of thought, entered the shop. Only [/INST] to find himself staring at a man holding a girl to the wall at the other end of the store. Making a low whistle, Whizzle glanced at the empty cashier before looking at the pair of lovers again.
""So...heh, is the store still open or should I came back later?"" he asked.
-----
Alice looked up from her mostly eaten food and blinked at noblewoman who took a seat besides her and asked a question afterward. It was obvious to her that the noblewoman wouldn't take a no for an answer and Alice inwardly sighed. ""No, it is not,"" Alice said while looking at the woman. She was almost finished with her food, so it's not like she has to linger around for whatever the noble was thinking. </s>"
60,"<s>[INST] Selest looks at Nathan surprised when he asks her to wait there. Not that it didn't tickle her annoyance a bit, but she was a bit surprised that he would ask a person who he denied having any relation with to wait instead of dismiss them like every other person in the future did when it came to her mother. Selest gave off a deep sigh, but awaited patiently for Nathan to return. She looked around in his house to notice it was pretty bare and rundown. She didn't quite understand why Nathan who worked for the military continued to live in a dwelling that provided just the necessities when he could live in a house like her mother did when she worked for the Windgrace government before she was coronated with her mother's crown. A crown she received from a girl who helped train Selest along with a mysterious cold and very quiet woman named Siianthaliae.
Selest shook her head at the thought of Nathan's bare house whispering to herself that he is such a fool. Not only was he responsible for the event she could not forgive him for, but he thinks himself lowly when he descends from a very wealthy family line and she is sure his descendants wouldn't want to see him like this. He definitely knew how to make her upset over him putting himself down feeling sorry for himself. She wanted earlier to yell at him for apologizing for what his adult self did which did anger Selest though she hid it inside herself trying not to let even her eyes show that it irritated her.
Selest patience was about to give until he returned with a set of swords which Selest known as the twin blades of the Ereseal family. When he offered her the swords she was a bit caused by surprise thinking that he valued those blades, because they were the only part of his parents he had left to remember them by. She sighed as she looked at blades then reached into her pocket and gave him an old photo that was faded, but on one side contained a picture of Nathan's parents and the other side contained a picture of Selest's parents. She ran her hand across the blade examining while she handed him the photo. ""You really are hopeless. Running away from your past, because you're offering me these swords and now denying who you are. What makes you think my mother judged people by how wealthy they are? Are you trying to insult what my mother fought for in my future!"" Selest raised her voice as you could see the anger in her eyes burn full of hatred. Something was bothering her that she didn't tell him. Her eyes looked like they were on fire with anger as she peered at Nathan was tired of hearing his excuses.
Selest stood up reached over and picked Nathan up into the air by his shirt despite being a very feminine built figure. She generates destructive energy into her fist which causes the reality around her to slightly distort itself. She had used the technique several times in the past and had learned the Explosive Vise technique from Ranathia who was a mastermind when it came to fire and destructive capabilities of the element. Ranathia had trained Selest on how to use the explosiveness of the fire element and use that power as a very destructive force by compressing it tight, with her fist the trigger when it came into contact with a very solid object. She wanted to strike him with the fist, but Ranathia warned her that hitting organisms with the attack would result in certain death especially if their guard was completely down. She instead struck the chair she created with her fist which e [/INST] xploded when it came into contact with the chair incinerating it into nothingness and Selest turned around releasing Nathan and then shielded him from the chain reaction that ensued though it was more of a reaction that she had no control over. ""You are so pathetic.""
""Why do you deny the fact you are my father? Are you too good for me? You fool! Are you abandoning my mother! Father you are such an idiot!"" Selest yelled as she turned her attention toward the swords that Nathan had given to her. She closely examined the blades more closely as she tried to distract herself from getting angry. She didn't want to waste her time calling her father out for how stupid he was since it would just be repeating what happened between the two in the past. She took her hand and activated a hidden glyph on Ragnadaim which caused the blades to transform into a pair of knuckles. ""Even then you were to stupid to figure out that Ragdnadaim could transform into any weapon the user desired. Since you enjoy using your fists like a brute, here."" She paused as she handed back a pair of fancy looking metallic like knuckles back to Nathan before she continued. ""These might be more suitable for you. Since you like to use your fists this weapon is more of what represents your character. I don't want Ragnadaim and if you want to abandon your past then don't throw it on me. It's obvious you don't care about me. Just like in the future you are no different than you are now which makes me sick. I can't stand looking at you. If you want to die that badly then use the same technique I did and punch yourself with those knuckles. It's obvious you see me as nothing more than a burden and never cared about me. I guess the future was doomed from the very beginning when you abandoned your resolve."" Selest concluded as she slowly walked away from her father trying to hold back the tears that were about to reveal themselves in her eyes. It was obvious the girl was heartbroken by Nathan and was even more annoyed by the fact Nathan had not really changed that much from who he was in the past.

Siia looks over toward Whizzle and frowns at him for just standing there. The man uses his free hand and clamps it over her mouth to prevent her from screaming. He then turns around and faces Whizzle nodding at him, ""I had to detain a customer, because she was getting in over her head. She tried to assault me so I took it into my authority to restrain her."" He said in a trying voice though you could notice by the tone in his voice that he was obviously lying. Siia looked over toward Whizzle hoping that he wouldn't beleive such an idiot, because if he did she might just have to explode and tear the roof off the building. As undesirable as it sounds, she waited to see what Whizzle was going to do while shaking her head trying to force the man's hand off of her mouth which he had it clamped over tight.
""Now move along, little man. There's nothing to see here and we don't need your help. You might get hurt if you stick around."" The man grinned as his cronies walked in Whizzle's direction and stopped in front of him with intimidating looks on their faces. They cracked their knuckles as they prepared to pounce on the suspecting individual if they didn't leave, ""Yo heard our boss. Get lost, wimp otherwise these muscles of ours are going to turn you into a prune."" </s>"
61,"<s>[INST] Selest heard Nathan ask her to wait as she walked off where she decided to stop and turn around once again facing him. When she turned to face him again she noticed he was crying. She remembered that he asked her if he was her real father, but she didn't answer him. She decided that she would answer him this time. ""Yes, you are my real biological father. That picture is proof of that."" When he asked if he was crying she sighed and said yes. She then walked back over toward him and pulled his head up toward her eyes which were two different colors. One eye was the color of her mother which was blue, but her other eye was very strange looking which was an orange reddish color.
She wanted Nathan to look at her eyes. Perhaps he might try to at least understand himself better and stop being so afraid of his power within him. Selest was the same way in the past and she knew that it only brought her pain and sorrow. ""Look at this eye."" She pointed at which was an orange reddish color. She wanted him to know about the truth of what happened to her and the price she paid for doing it. ""I was the very same as you, father. But it brought me nothing other than [/INST] suffering.I couldn't even protect those dearest to me and they all died protecting me. And for what? This eye is the price I paid for my carelessness. I traveled back into time when I made an agreement with an entity known as Cinis otherwise known as the Voice of Origin. I had to exchange one of my blue eyes for its eyes which was the Eye of Chaos. It was the only way I could travel back into time and ascend destiny without causing a paradox. This eye grants me safe haven from both, but it doesn't mean I can't die. Just that I am not connected to your Universe yet, because I don't exist physically yet. The place I came from is a very unpleasant future."" She added as she pulled the back of her shirt to reveal some scars she had been dealt that look like something clawed at her back. ""These scars were caused by the abominations that have been sealed away called demons. The deities hid the existence of demons and this being called Cinis locked all them and everything that is really bad inside the Netherworld. The Pandora's Box is going to be opened during your lifetime and we cannot allow that. I'm the last hope in my time since everyone else has died."" </s>"
62,"<s>[INST] Ranathia looked at Alexander a bit offended when he insisted that he didn't quite trust her. This was quite an insult to Ranathia considering the fact she protected Meira's mother Melianth during the times where Ariesu tried to bring destruction toward the Universe. For him to think that she would not protect her own daughter did not sit well for Ranathia, but when she was about to say something about it after trying to trust Alexander she noticed Alexander had caught someone eavesdropping on them. She was a bit concerned if they were listening in on her conversation she was having earlier. Such information was dangerous in the wrong hands where she had to act opening the brown wooden rectangular door and turning the slender egg shaped door knob as she opened the door and took in the fresh air she felt on her lungs as she walked outside toward this individual.
She approached the person who was dog like in appearance carefully keeping her hand near her weapon in case they were hostile. Ranathia didn't draw her weapon as she felt Meira would not like that. When she was about to ask the individual a question she noticed Meira had interrupted her asking her what was going on. Meira was unsure on why this person was there, but she did have a few questions of her own. ""Who is this person, Ranathia?"" Meira questioned toward Ranathia as curiosity lit like a candle burning inside her mind.
Ranathia shook her head and replied simply, ""I don't know."" She had a calm casual tone, but a serious cautious look on her face and in her eyes as she approached this person. She was a bit hesitant approaching the person since she saw they were male. The opposite gender made her feel a bit uneasy and she could feel a trickle of that inside her body. Not enough of it to really give an impression she felt that, but it did trouble her a bit. ""Who exactly are you and what are you doing here?"" Ranathia paused for a moment as she rested her hand gently on her blade stepping closer to the dog like figure. ""I can sense that you are not an enemy. I don't sense any negative vibe about you, but still I'm rather curious why you chose to look around a place like this?"" She questioned as she awaited his response to her question. Meira remained quiet, but did notice some movement in one of the trees toward the back of her house. She thought she saw an individual inside the tree where she did get a glimpse of what looked like a white piece of clothing which looked like a dress. ""Curse you, Sentius... This curse makes it hard for me to travel around and if I come down my sister will just make fun of me. I hate looking like this and not having all my wisdom..."" The girl complained as she stayed hidden out of sight in the tree observing the situation and also noticing her sister Miia was peering on the group from a distance on the ground standing in front of the gate.
""This is private property owned by the Rystaliuskal [/INST] family. You are trespassing and as an officer I have to take action. I will not arrest you or give you a citation if you give me a legitimate reason why you're here."" Ranathia added as she thought it rather strange that he got by security unless he passed through the gate during the shift change.

Nathan tried to get her attention asking, ""...wait. My parents are dead, they have been for almost a decade now. So how could this picture exist? Not only that, but it looks old...really old. Just...when was this taken?""
Selest stopped but she didn't know how old the photograph was. Her father never told her how old the photo was, but did call it his lucky charm that kept him going entrusting it to her when he sacrificed his life to shield her from harm. She wasn't sure what she should tell Nathan and what to tell him since there are some things that are better off left unknown. If she revealed his fate in the future him then it would trouble him, but if she were to reveal the woman he marries which was her mother dies protecting them both then he might not know how to handle it. The picture was a reminder that she was not alone no matter how far those who she loved were away from her to never return. She was a bit disappointed as she shook her head since she had to reveal that she didn't even know when that picture was taken; moreover, she didn't even know when the flip-side was taken. ""I'm sorry, I don't know the answer to that question, but an apocalypse is brewing as we know it and this our only chance to prevent it. You are not alone in finding it hard to believe someone like you marries my mother, but that just shows you how much of a heart she has. Do not break her heart or I'll break your neck. If you are never to marry and I am to die then I'll at least die reassured I got vengeance on the man who broke her heart."" Selest threatened as she turned her face away from him and started to make her way out of the house. She had overstayed her welcome and he might try to ask her more questions she could not answer. All she could is tell him what was safe. It wasn't like she wanted to keep secrets, but they may impact the events that are supposed to follow. She was hoping that her influence had no impact on how Nathan and Meira met so she could later be born.
""I must be on my way. Do not disappoint me, father. I will never forgive you if you do. Keep mother safe and happy, that is all I ask of you."" She said with her back turned as she made her way out the door and walked away from Nathan's house. She wanted to stay to reveal what was about to happen and how it impacted the current future, but she feared it might affect the fact Meira and Nathan meet which in turn would cause her to cease to exist. It was better if there were things he didn't know. </s>"

Mostly notable, was that the girl who was the security guard had no soul, and the other guard in armor and the noble girl also had very strange souls that seem to just ooze power. ""Ok, I have no idea what I got myself into but y'all, y'all aren't normal."" he said, completely dropping his fake voice he put on to match his false persona of a journalist and put on his regular voice.
He started to back up, easily breaking free of the holding spell placed on him and he ma [/INST] terialized Sloth into his hand and shoot at Alexander, the sudden shock made it hard for him to speck as he dropped to his knees. ""How about this. You leave me be and in a few hours I will go about my job and you probably never see me again. Beside, it looks you have bigger problems in your hand, there is a guy over there hidden and feels really strong, another person over there even stronger, and another person over there who I can't even tell how strong she is. So know, if you excuse me."" he said, getting up and casually walking away while still trying to be hyper alert about what is behind him. </s>"
64,"<s>[INST] Fenrir was with the others at the coronation to his grimace, but Meira insisted he came. He never did like basically any from the upper-class class, granted, he doesn't really like all that many different types of people. However he did feel nervous about the Cimmeria's being here. He thought to himself, ""Just keep your cool. I will get Meria to trust me and think I am just a dumb little kid she picked up off the street, I will get her to help me rescue the other werewolves they are keeping in Cimmeria and then I will gone and we will look for the others and then just find us a nice werewolf controlled pl [/INST] ace to settle down. I can't let this go wrong just because I lose my temper. My brothers freedom are way more important than petty revenge.""
However his thoughts were put on hold when he noticed Nathan. All he know about that person was his name and Fenrir could sense something wasn't quite right about him. He decided that talking to him might get his mind of Cimmeria for a while. He walked up to him and said, ""What is you're deal. You look like you're going to punch a guy just if they poked you."" He then took a moment to sniff the air, and some thing really didn't seem quite right with this Nathan fellow. </s>"
65,"<s>[INST] Unbeknownst to the Duke and Meira, one of the guest had also planned to ask for a private audience with the princess and decided to ambush her on the way back after the Duke finished his conversation with the princess. When the Duke headed back to the hall with a pleased look on his face but with no sign of the princess, it wasn't hard to guess that the duke had done something, especially when there're two armed guards guarding a room in an empty area. He almost stepped out to meet the guards and asked but decided not to upon realizing their tenseness. Something was up.
Tapping a finger to his side, the noble considered his option, Should I inform Prime about this....hmmm.
Inform me what? a disembodied voice echoed in his head without any warning.
That a change of plan might be needed. he replied without missing a beat.
.....The two bitches are here. [/INST] ....no changes on the plan. We make do whatever happen.
The duke would make an awful choice.
....That concern is....secondary...
Ah....you're going to help then?....Hello?.....Hmph, fine, don't answer.
Finished with the quick conversation with no one, the noble walked away from his place and headed down.

Alice was still walking around to find the noble that lend her the dress she was wearing and noticed the sudden addition of guards stationed around the hall. She passes it on as the time for the coronation nearing and warily looked towards the center of the room. She had walked around the side of the room several times and had not found the noble yet, which meant it was likely that the noble was hanging around the center. Should she look there? No, that probably would attract attention to her.
Might as well head to the doors then, Alice sighed. </s>"

Unseen [/INST] by naked eyes, a spirit wandered into the room that held Meira and Reala. The intruder took stock to the location of the people inside the room before floating around them all and passed an arm through them as he floated past.

67,"<s>[INST] As if she picked up his thought, Whizzle approached the Angelian. Still keeping her smile, Whizzle gave a greeting nod to him. ""Greetings, I'm sorry, but I notice that you're looking quite alarmed while in the middle of a ball. Is something the matter or are you currently constipating?""
-----
Alice looked at the guards' strange order before complying and turned back. She noticed that she wasn't the first to be turned around as some of the other guests seemed to take a glance at the door and its guards, as if expecting them to suddenly vanish and open. Looking closer, Alice noticed that one of the guests taking glances at the door was one familiar noble that she was acquainted with the night before. Biting her lip, Alice weighted her options. Should she approach the weird noble and ask whether she knew what happened or should she stay still and watch the guard?
Her decision made, Alice took a deep breath and walked towards Melianth and her rather large group. After attracting their attention, Alice would gave a polite bow, particularly to Luhsein, whose face she noticed from news, and Melianth, the one she wanted to talk to. ""I am sorry for my rudeness but..."" Alice said as she looked up from her bow and paused mid-sentence as she [/INST] saw that one of the group's member was the noble who put her in a dress, only differently clothed and different hair color. Alice's words was halted in her throat as she stared at the silver haired female noble.

The spirit watched the scene unfolding inside the room in mild irritation and slightly more amusement. Amusement as the bound girl on the bed had shown to be an aberration as he could not easily read her soul and soon after exhibited both knowledge of how to deal with the intangible spirits and that she owned a sword that could even affect him. No, not a sword, a holy sword meant to do just that. Irritation as the girl soon hid herself from his senses, leaving him alone with the ignoramus that called themselves guards. It would seem that 'siding' with Meira were the better choice as the guards rushed out after one of them was thrown outside to plummet to the ground. He wondered if he should made his move now, there were only a couple of guards left behind and if his thought is correct, they wouldn't be adequate to fight him off even if he took one of the guards' body and set them against each other. He might even be able to finish his business faster....Although that probably would attract some unwarranted attention. </s>"

Alice sucked her breath as she was reprimanded and bowed an apology, ""I'm sorry! But your twin sister put me in this dress and..."" She trailed as her [/INST] mind registered that the noble called her as a young girl as if she was much, much older than she looked. ""And..uh, I'm looking for her...""

The spirit observed the room for a moment to see if there's anyone hidden still. Confident that no one else would enter or otherwise interrupt, he set his eyes to the guards and set to work, starting with the guards' leader. </s>"

""Aww, don't be like that, you'll find me helpful and nice if you let me help,"" she sweetly said and Mithos would find it hard to disagree with the argument. ""I swear on my family name~""
A new person decided to join in their conversation. Whizzle turn to find the person she was impersonating as dragging Alice. Whizzle noticed that she was called by name. She hid her confusion as she looked between the girl and Alice. Silence fell between them before Alice spoke first. [/INST] ""Uh, I'm sorry, what did you say her name is?"" Alice asked. ""She can't be Whizzle. I know him and he's neither a girl or has enough magic to disguise himself completely like that.""

Nathan would find someone stood on the door that he broke on his way in. Meira, if she's able to concentrate after, would notice that it was the leader of the guards but there were no signs of any of his underlings. Both of them would realize that he's far too pale for a human.
""I...can't...let you do that,"" the guard slowly said. His voice however, sounded guttural. </s>"

Another noble appeared and started talking before she had the chance to do so however.

As you command."" obviously drenched in sarcasm. The older one moaned, and continued to speak the perso [/INST] n now in front of him, ""We are returning Cimmerian property back to Cimmeria. If you want him so badly, you could try buying him, even though this savage is probably cost a million times the amount of worth your life is. I suggest you leave before this becomes an incident. We have to wait here for the transport to arrive."" </s>"
74,"<s>[INST] The beast growled as Nathan drove towards it. The tackle staggered the beast backward before it balanced itself, Nathan was too light and too close to gather the needed momentum to topple the beast. As Nathan had his arms around the beast, he'd notice the beast was growing in size. It was also getting stronger as Nathan had started to being pushed back and down by the beast.
Meira watched as Nathan fought the beast as she tried to come up with a plan to help Nathan deal with the menace. She knew full well that most of her arsenal was out of the question though she did have an idea which she heard her teacher Siianthaliae talk about. The only problem was she had not ever used a Unison before and she had no training in how to use synchronized moves. It was a large gamble, but with the stakes like they were she decided it was one she was willing to take.
She looked over toward Nathan as she had finally come up with the perfect move to deal with the monster. She concentrated her energy at a fixed point then calmly toward Nathan, ""Nathan, join with me into a Unison attack. We will combine our two moves to purge this impurity here and now!""
Shoving the beast off to the side, Nathan got back up. ""Wait...what?"" he questioned Meira. He was a little lost. 'What the hell is a Unison attack? Gah, I don't have time to think about this.' He shook off his confusion and said to Meira ""alright. Just tell me what to do"" He was going to have to follow her lead, since not only had he never preformed a 'Unison attack' but he was also inexperienced fighting along side other people. Until she made her move, All he could do was keep this...this...thing away from her
The beast was thrown off-balance and slid across the ground a few meters before stopping and recovered. The black scales had covered more of the formerly human body and the growth on its shoulder were larger as well and had a split formed over the top of each. With a snarl, the beast launched itself at Nathan once more, unheeding of whatever plan they're concocting.
Meira just remembered she did not have her sword so her arsenal was limited until she heard a familiar voice that said ""here"" throwing her the sword which she caught with her hand. She was surprised to see that same girl she saw earlier who was captured alongside her. She knew when she got full glimpse of her that she was ""You must be Reala?""
""We can talk later. First we must deal with this beast first."" Reala added as she landed on the ground right beside Meira. She moved into a defensive position as she saw Meira about to perform a technique.
Meira positions her hand in the air as a magic circle forms below her feet. Her hand starts to flicker with a darkish spark as she starts to command a black flame in her hand. She shifts the circle over toward Nathan where he will along with Meira be engulfed with a blackish flame aura. ""Ready, Nathan?"" Meira questioned as she moved her hands into an attack position while putting her sword away for the time being.
Normaly when he used fire, Nathan went for a large area of effect, so that the flames would spread faster. However since this creature didn't look as flammable as his normal foes, he opted for something different. Tuning out the strange girl who had just arrived (battles weren't really a good time to hold conversations), he released his flame all over his body, letting it mingle with the fire that Meira covered him in. Once the two were sufficiently mixed, he began to concentrate them into a single ball between his hand. This didn't take too long as he had a natural affinity for fire.
It was not fast enough as the beast barreled into Nathan as he was trying to form the fireball. The flame covering Nathan was affecting the beast as unprotected flesh came in contact with the empowered flame. Even the beast's new scales wasn't enough to fully withstand it and they cracked under the strain. It still pressed on despite and attempted to maul Nathan with clawed hands. Meira and Reala's presence did not seem to register on the beast yet.
""Oh no you do not!"" Reala exclaimed as she charged at the beast with her sword attempting to make a direct hit with her sword in order to ram it so she could give both Meira and Nathan more time to prepare their move. ""Take this! Spirit Buster!"" She finished as she attempted to not only ram the beast, but with a powerful veil of light around her that would act as a shield when she made contact.
Meira took the time to generate energy into her body and transfer the darkish flame aura around her to Nathan so they could finally deliver their cooperation attack. She let loose an enormous amount of her fiery aura as she sent it at Nathan to empower him with. ""Use the Devil's Fire on him, Nathan! I'll transform into a Spirit and let you borrow my power to command it!"" Meira exclaimed as her body started to illuminate where her appearance changed. Her body bathed a white leotard with a white skirt and some thigh highs and boots to go along with her new look. Also on her back appeared six wings which were each a different color.
Reala's charge met some success as her sword dug into the beast's left side. She found that she was unable to penetrate any deeper than the tip of the sword even as the force of her charge dislocate the beast from trying to maul Nathan further. Snarling at its new opponent, the beast ignored the blade on its stomach and swiped at Reala.
""No way!"" She said in surprise. ""I cannot believe it managed to survive that attack. Dammit, my sword is stuck and there's nothing I can do now, but pull back."" She said in frustration as she released the handle of the sword as the beast tried to attack her then palm her two hands in front of her and used the excess force of her attack to propel herself backward out of harm's way before signaling to Nathan that his opportunity was now. ""This is your one chance, do not let it slip away."" Reala reminded him as she safely landed on her feet right beside Meira. Unfortunately the Spirit Sword Celesna was still stuck in the beast and she didn't have time to extract the sword without taking a hit. She knew that she could not let that sword fall into the wrong hands. Melianth had reminded her that the sword could be used as a conductor to control her power with should someone learn how to manipulate properly.
Meira's energy started to emanate brightly as dark flames shrouded her entire a body and a giant black serpent like dragon wrapped itself around her loosely allowing her to use its power. Her eyes looked lifeless and she had no emotion on her face. She pointed at the beast for Nathan letting him know her power was ready for him to command. ""Do you desire the power beyond the darkness?"" Meira said strangely as she was not acting like herself at all.
Things were quickly getting weirder and weirder. First there was this...thing, then this strange girl appeared, and then Meira suddenly started getting taken over by the weirdness itself. To be honest, Nathan was getting tired of it. ""Nope, I'm good"" he answered her, as he felt it was the only safe answer to give. Getting back up, he took the strange fire that she had given him, he poured it all into his fire and quickly reformed the fireball he failed to finish before...and then he ate it.
His body began crackling with embers of both flames. ""Let's get this over with"" he said as he charged at the monster. Starting off his attack with a kick to the gut to knock it back, he followed up with a hard hook to the face, along with five more to the chest area. With his opponent dazed, he launched it up into the air with an uppercut. As it began to fall back down to the ground, he unleashed a flury of punches so fast, it looked like he had grown extra arms. The force of his attack was actually propelling the creature upwards. When his assault had finished and it began to fall back down again, he spun his body in place, forcing the flames inside of him into his fist as he drove it into the stomach of the monster. As his fist connected with it, all the fire that he had consumed exploded out of his hand, sending the creature flying.
The beast collided against the castle's wall, unable to hold against the momentum the wall crumbled as the mass sped pass it before stopping against the wall on the opposite side of the hall it ended in. The blackened body sled down the wall down to its rear, a hole in the center of mass where Nathan hit it visible while Reala's sword still stuck to it on a sliver of flesh, smoke and the smell of burnt flesh raising from it. Yet for all the damage it received, the beast was clearly still alive as it twitched in its pitiful attempt to move. Its eyes shot unrestrained hostility towards those who came close yet its body refused to listen to its desire to brutally hurt them.
Meira looked on as she saw the beast still moving despite the massive damage it had taken. Her expression had not changed ever since she transformed. While she still remained in her position behind Nathan, she peered into the beast's eyes trying to make contact with its heart. ""I asketh this of you, thou wish to be released from the restraints that confine it to the everlasting misery that it bathes in?"" Meira questioned toward the beast in a prophetic riddle tone as she still showed no sign of emotion on her face. Reala even knew something was different about Meira since she never acted like this before. The only people she knew who act like Meira are Lady Siia and her sister Miia. Neither of them were present and she sensed an otherworldly presence inside Meira which didn't feel anything like her.
As Meira continued to look on emotionless thoughts revolved around in her head sending her state of mind into a rapid tailspin. ""You know you want it. You know death is what it deserves. You know you're hungry for more. You know you want to devour everything you love. Do not resist your desire to destroy. Annihilate and devour everything around you!"" The voice said to her, but Meira while in a struggle with her mind shook her head with a look of disbelief. She wasn't sure what to do. Not even sure if she should even listen to the entity.
While Meira was still in the state of confusion, something took control of her body and started to speak toward her as she had flashbacks of her foster parent's death spiraling around in her mind. ""You killed them, Meira. This is what you are. You are an Angel of Destruction hellbent on annihilation. You and I share the same resolve of wanting to devour all of existence. Entrust yourself to me and I shall release you from the misery of your painful memories. You will have to suffer no more.""
""Do not listen to that voice, Meira. That voice is of the all-ending entity that only wishes to return everything to the void of nothingness. I know you better than this. You do not wish to hurt others. You'd even be harming innocents. Stop listening to that voice!"" Reala pleaded toward Meira hoping that her persuasion might snap Meira back to her senses. Somehow she knew something had taken over her spirit form, but she wasn't sure what. She did sense a very evil and ominous aura from the presence of this being.
Meira continued to struggle to find herself despite hearing Reala's words loud and clear. She still had visions of the nightmares of the girl that looked like her who massacred her foster family. This girl was grinning as she was saturated in blood licking the blood off a blade that looked just like Meleitling. ""What if I did really kill them? Am I no different than those who I des [/INST] pise? Am I a hypocrite caught in my own web of misery?"" She questioned toward herself inside her mind as she tried to find some answer to give clarity to what was going on.
A voice pierced the area as it spoke directly toward Nathan sounding unconvinced. ""Do you actually think you can save her from herself, foolish boy? What makes you think you can stop her? You cannot even control your own power yet you feel emboldened to protect this girl? Don't make me laugh you sorry excuse for existence. Just kill her. It is the only way to prevent the catastrophe that is written in the prophecies. Do that, and you will be a hero. Isn't that what you want? To make a name for yourself? To be someone? Answer me boy!""
Nathan had thought that taking down that strange monster would end the weirdness, he was wrong. When voice from nowhere began to speak to him, he just sighed and took it in stride 'this is going to be my whole day isn't it?' Resigned to this, he answered the voice ""clearly you're mistaken; I don't care if I'm a hero or even a somebody. So there's no way I'm going to kill someone who hasn't done anything yet. Also, I find it odd how hard you're trying to convince me to kill her. I'm starting to wonder if you're the one who's going to cause this catastrophe you just mentioned, and that with Meira dead, no one could stop you. So no, I won't kill her.""
""So you would doom your own kind for the sake of one girl? How naive could you be? Have you forsaken your own race in hope of helping this nuisance? Have it your way then. But I think you're in over your head if you think you can protect her from her eventual fate. I will do what I must in order to allow our kind to survive. Even if that means sacrificing a girl in order to bring about the greater good. Are you telling me, you'd stand in the way of your own ancestors in order to protect her?"" The voice questioned toward Nathan still not showing itself and secluding itself from sight.
""Wow, you really don't have a clue who you're talking to"" Nathan was actually a little surprised ""I gave up on my own race years ago. Hell, I've been wandering around killing my own race for a few years. I'm also used to being in over my head, it's where I'm at my best oddly enough. Your mind games aren't going to work on me, I've resisted better attempts, so you'd be better off not wasting your breath""
""You'll regret your decision. Turning your own back on your own kind. I will make sure that I stain your very betrayal on that pathetic body of yours. Now that you've made us your enemy, you better think about watching your own back as well. It will be interesting to see if you can protect yourself and this girl at the same-time? But I will warn you, she will devour you eventually. For now, I will let you be. I will seize my opportunity at another time."" The voice concluded as it disappeared from sight and not another word was heard from it.
""Nathan, are you sure that was wise?"" Reala questioned as she stood by and interpretted the whole conversation.
Nathan shrugged ""no clue. But I've done tons of stupid things in the past, and I'm still alive"" he answered. ""The question is, what are we going to do about her?"" He asked while turning to Meira ""she's not looking to good. I think she might have gotten hit by some sort of mental attack. I'm clueless when it comes to stuff like that, so I hope you know something about the subject. Otherwise we'll have to find someone else who can help her""
Meira had finally returned to her senses, but her state of mind was damaged by everything she heard and she wasn't sure what to believe anymore. ""Am I no different than a monster? Am I really just some Angel of Destruction meant to devour all of existence. I killed..."" She paused as tears started to roll down her eyes as the emotion in her body started to come back to life. ""I killed them, didn't I? I always tried to make an excuse in the past when I was a child that it was someone else that looked like me, but that was really me, wasn't it? Yet now I am here killing a monster that I am no different from? I have no right to judge when I committed the same sins as this beast. If I give into my desire to destroy, will all the pain go away?"" She questioned as she continued to speak softly in a damaged state of mind about what she had done.
Another voice pierced the sky which everyone could hear. This voice was different from all the other's and sounded just like how Meira was talking a moment ago when something inside her was trying to convince her she was corrupted. ""Yes, release your pain and let me take over. You will have to suffer no more. I will destroy everything including those you love so you never have to cling to anything again. You will never have to suffer again. Let me make your decisions for you. You can rest in a paradise I will create for you while I do all your bidding for you."" It said toward Meira as Reala could only sit there and watch not knowing what to do. She didn't know what words to use to persuade Meira not to listen to such a being. She was hoping Nathan might have the answer. It was the only thing she could hope for at the moment.
Nathan was ready for today to end already. So many crazy things had happened already, and it looked like more were to come. ""This isn't good"" he mumbled. ""Meira, don't let her trick you! If there's anything I've learned in my life, it's to never ever listen to voices that come out of nowhere, EVER! Nothing good can ever come of it. Whoever she is, she's probably lying to you. If you let her win, then everything you're trying to do will be wasted! Don't let that happen! Is that what you really want; to live in an empty world all alone forever!?""
""Alone?"" Meira questioned as she wasn't sure what to do. ""I..."" She muttered for a moment still completely confused. The entity was impressed by how much she was resisting that it decided not to get aggressive. It waited to see how she would react afterward. ""I don't know... But I cannot let you take control over me. Not until I know the answer. For now I will reject you and resist you with all my strength."" She pleaded as she shook her head refusing the request from the voice.
""Foolish girl, you would listen to the words of a naive mortal who abandoned his own race? What makes you think he won't do the same to you?"" The voice questioned toward Meira hoping that it would get a favorable response from her.
""Abandon me? Would you really do that, Nathan?"" She said confused not knowing what to with everything still spiraling around her mind in an endless paradox.
""You have to stop listening to her"" Nathan said ""she'll say whatever she thinks will break you"" he warned. ""My entire race suffers from a madness that flows through our very blood. I've been fighting it for a long time, but in my life the only other members of my race I've met who weren't family have all given into it, embraced that madness. That's why I've abandoned them, and that's why most of the blood on my hands is from my own kin. As long as you keep fighting whatever it is that's inside of you, I'll be there. After all, I'll need to you take care of me when I finally lose to the madness in my blood""
""Maybe he's right..."" Meira questioned as she tried to fight the madness that spiraled out of control in her body. ""We are two sides of the same coin meant to help one another."" She paused for a moment surprised by how concern Nathan was about her. This concern from her was quite different than the other compassion she felt from him. She felt a slight warmth inside her cold heart that started to sparkle a little.
""So, you would listen to the words of a fool?"" The voice questioned toward Meira interpreting that she had not fallen for its words.
""I don't know, but I do know that until I know the truth, I will continue to strive for it. I cannot turn my back just, because I am unsure about the mist that fogs my mind about my past. But he's right, I would be allowing myself to be secluded into the same solitude I tried to get away from. I do not want to be a hypocrite of my own words so my answer is no. I will not let you do what you please.""
""What makes you think finding out the answer will make anything easier for you? You mortals are ambitious curious fools who eventually consume themselves in the madness of their own swelling past."" A brief paused before its voice concentrated back on Nathan. ""So be it, but do not think you have won, boy. Because you have not. One day, she may even devour you. Would you fight her even then?"" The voice questioned toward Nathan awaiting a response from him before it parted.
Nathan raised an eyebrow ""clearly you didn't hear me; I'm counting on her being the one to kill me when I finally go mad. I'll only fight her if she waits too long to go through with it, and I stop being myself."" Nathan sighed ""well if that's everything, we really should be getting back to that party. We need to let everyone know that you're alright"" he said to Meira
""Wait, what!?"" Meira said in surprise when she overheard Nathan talking to the voice about killing him. She couldn't believe Nathan had just said that. What she heard irritated her so much she turned her attention toward Nathan, ""I can't believe what you just said."" She paused before she continued in a tone which was all too familiar. ""Stupid, stupid, stupid..."" She said at the end in the same tone she spoke toward Nathan when he said anything that wasn't logical meaning it was pretty careless or idiotic to say. ""You haven't changed one bit, Nathan. Still as childish as ever."" She added with a brief smile on her face.
Reala began to smile since it was great to see her sister back to herself and in rather higher spirits than she was before. She knew inside she was still struggling to find the answer, but this time she wouldn't turn her back on everything she accomplished while she looked for the answer herself.
Nathan rubbed the back of his head ""yeah...well. Anyway, we really need to get back to the party, like now. Who knows what's going on in there now. Your aunt needs to know that you're still alive after all."" Just then, he noticed the beast out of the corner of his eyes. ""The hell?"" He walked over to it and pulled out the sword still stuck in it. ""Is...is this thing still alive?"" He was answered when he saw a little bit of movement from it. ""Well damn, I didn't expect that. Oh well, still got to finish it."" Since beating it to death had very limited success, Nathan decided to try something else. Grabbing it's head with both of his hands, he squeezed on it with all of his Dragonite strength.
Reala and Meira were both caught by surprise that the beast was still alive, but gave a sigh of relief once Nathan had finished it. Reala emanated energy into her hand as she made it glow like a roman candle where her sword did the same. She used that energy like a magnet to attract her sword back to her hand which she caught after she removed it from the beast's body. ""It would be bad if Celesna were to fall into the hands of malice."" Reala remarked as she turned away the monster ready to walk away and see what was going on downstairs.
""That's the legendary Spirit Sword Celesna which is said to be crafted from the hairs of the Goddess known as Aira, isn't Reala?"" Meira questioned as she also began to walk away from the seen happy to see the beast was dead. She was also back in her original wardrobe from before.
""Yes."" Reala answered her quickly as she wanted to get back to help the situation below which she knew might be quite dire at the moment. </s>"
75,"<s>[INST] Oh no! Meira said as she was caught by complete surprise. She didn't want to go to her classes since she found them extremely boring. Who cares about learning the proper way of ruling a nation? Why did she need to learn all that anyway? Meira contemplated in her mind as she didn't w [/INST] ant to reveal herself, but decided to open the door walking out of her hiding place. ""I don't want to go to classes. All that nobility talk is so boring and who cares how governments work anyway?"" Meira whined as she knew she had been busted yet again for trying to ditch her classes. </s>"
76,"<s>[INST] 'Why does she even bother fighting it? She has to know that someone will find her and force her back into class' Mithos wondered to himself. With a sigh, he returned to his quarters to pick his book back up and resume his reading. 'Har [/INST] d to believe that this is my life now' he thought to himself. 'How strange is it that I don't mind that I've been reduced to a glorified babysitter nearly as much as I should? Still, I can't help but wonder just how long this will take' </s>"
77,"<s>[INST] Ranathia had passed by as she saw Mithos was making sure Meira was attending her classes. She couldn't help but remember what happened a month ago, but she wasn't entirely sure herself if Mithos was handling himself well even after they cleared his name. She wanted to speak to him again, but she wasn't sure if now was a good time. ""Must be difficult for you having to clean up your own mess alone. You know..."" She paused for a moment as she moved into a more comfortable position so that they could face eye to eye. ""It was the same way for me. Causi [/INST] ng havoc then you have to try to seclude yourself from the public, because everyone looks at you like you're a villain. It's one thing that can eat your alive from the inside out..."" Ranathia said as she took another pause from as she walked over toward a chair beside Mithos and took a seat.
""Ranathia, is that you?"" Meira called out of her room as she was getting frustrated with her hand maidens forcefully dressing her in clothes she didn't really want to wear. She hated school clothes and the fact that they were color coded annoyed her even more. </s>"
78,"<s>[INST] Yes. Ranathia answered as she set the text she was looking at down on a table beside her. It was very true that she had become very busy with investigating the connection between the True Runes and their plane known as the Material Plane. After what happened, she couldn't help but want to learn how dangerous the Chaos Runes were and how to better deal with them so they didn't run into another situation like last time.
When he mentioned that she came to check up on her niece part of that was, but the real reason she was there is she wanted to investigate a mysterious ruin she read about in the text she set down on the table. ""It's true I came here to check up on my niece however..."" She paused for a moment as she shifted to a more comfortable position in her chair so that her posture looked better. ""That's not why I'm here. It's true I've been very busy since I became the head researcher for the arche [/INST] ologist division so a lot of my time is put forth studying ancient texts and old artifacts. Currently I am about to set out to look at some old mysterious ruins that people have been staying away from. I'd like to know what exactly is in these ruins which is repelling visitors. If you wouldn't mind and I'm sure you'd find it more a convenient way to use your time I'd like you to accompany me as my bodyguard.""
""Oh ruins! Can I go too?"" Meira questioned as she finally left her room after getting dressed. This was a chance for her to have a good reason for ditching her class and going on an adventure where they might discover some hidden secrets and perhaps fight some monsters.
""Oh no you don't!"" Ranathia said as she stood up from her chair knowing exactly what Meira was scheming. ""It's off to your studies for you. You are not using my expedition as an excuse to ditch class. Now off to school with you!"" </s>"
79,"<s>[INST] Thanks a lot! Meira said as she stormed out of the room in anger. It was obvious she didn't want to go to school, but if she were to become a better person she better start accepting her responsibilities.
""So you don't want to come?"" She said in disappointment since she wanted to try at least to get to know Mithos better. She knew he wasn't like the other boys since he had a phobia for females. Ranathia had always [/INST] been teased about the same phobia except hers were to males. ""I'm not forcing you to come with me. If you think I'm forcing you to come with me then don't come with me. I thought I'd at least..."" Ranathia said a bit irritated that Mithos was taking it like she was forcing him to go with her. ""Forget it! I'll find someone. Sorry for wasting your time."" She answered as she walked out of the room in a pretty foul mood. </s>"
80,"<s>[INST] Oh my! One of the hand maidens who was cleaning the room said as they stumbled across a very strange looking book that was sitting on a table next to where Mithos was reading. ""Mithos, who does this strange book belong to?"" She questioned as she picked up the book and showed it to Mithos while she got back to cleaning the room.
""The nerve of that..."" Ranathia whispered to herself as she mad [/INST] e her way toward the outside of the manor which Meira was staying at while the castle was being repaired. A lot of very tall buildings that stretched high up in the sky obscured anyone's view of the capital. You could also see from a distance the battered damaged castle from a distance which main entrance was completely collapsed in and the throne area you could see a giant hole in the roof. </s>"
81,"<s>[INST] The streets were crowded and Ranathia who was waiting to cross the street saw Mithos had tracked her down. She wasn't quite sure why so she turned around to face him. She saw that he held a book in her hands that she forgot about earlier. She knew it was due to her anger that [/INST] she felt toward him earlier that she accidentally left the book behind without thinking about it. ""Oh, yes thank you."" Ranathia said kindly as her mood had suddenly shifted when she realized the book was hers. ""But why did you go out of your way just to bring this back to me?"" </s>"
82,"<s>[INST] Ranathia took the book then headed for her vehicle which was parked on the other side of the street. When the traffic grew thin she decided to cross the street and walk toward the side her car was parked on. Before getting in she thought about what Mithos had said and remembered her contact had information about his aunt. ""Mithos."" Ranathia said as she turned around before she tried to unlock the door. ""I'm going to meet with one of my contacts and they said they have information regarding your aunt. You're more than welcome to accompany me, but if you're too busy I'll just drop a report by later."" Ranathia said as she unlocked the door and got in before closing it. Cars were very expensive in Windgrace and only the most wealthy of [/INST] citizens could ever afford one.
Ranathia couldn't help but feel sympathy for Mithos despite in the past she felt a lot of resentment toward him, because she blamed him for Reala's disappearance. She was pretty sure Reala was still alive since something inside her told her that she was.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Meanwhile Reala who was still recovering from her wounds had returned to the bakery that the boy worked at. She found his rolls very tasty which she usually ordered. The ones with cream were her favorite. ""I'm back again today, Danny. I'll have the same I usually have."" She said since Danny probably by now had her order memorized in his mind. </s>"
83,"<s>[INST] Well I was going to tell you that before you said I was imposing on you like other people. Ranathia hinted as she started the car driving off down the road to where she was going to meet with her contact. While driving toward the destination she passed many sights and also talked to Mithos about what she had learned so far.
""Here's what I've learned so far. It seems that the Kingdom of Eden is divided between two sides. The Angels of Light and the Angels of Darkness who do not get along at all. From what I learned is that the Angels of Darkness were behind the terrorist attack and were the ones who helped your uncle plan it. It seems the Angels of Darkness have been working with very shady people who I [/INST] wouldn't trust no matter how far I threw them."" Ranathia said as she continued to keep her eyes focused on the road.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
""Thanks."" Reala said as she took her bag and walked over taking a seat. She found it strange why she kept coming back to the place where she had first met this boy Danny. Though she convinced herself in the mind it's because the sweets are so delicious.
""Why don't you come over and have some and come talk to me, Danny-kun? Don't be so shy because I won't bite."" Reala asked him as she took one of the rolls out and took a bite out of it as she enjoyed the moistness of the delicious breading in her mouth. </s>"
84,"<s>[INST] Seriously Mithos, if you mope around like that forever your face is going to freeze. I don't know what you're thinking in that mind of yours and I don't think I want to know, but you need to try to move on. I'm doing what I can to help you on the side, but I also have my research and investigation to attend to. Ranathia said as she parked the car on the side of the road at an abandoned warehouse. The warehouse was rundown and didn't really have anything inside it other than a bunch of broken crates and pallets. ""All right, we're here."" Ranathia said toward Mithos as she reached over towa [/INST] rd her door handle to get out. She then closed the door behind her as she approached the exact location she was to meet up with her contact.
______________________________________________________________________________
""I was curious if you heard anything suspicious lately, seen suspicious activity or anyone suspicious at all?"" Reala questioned as she took another bite of her roll while passing one to Danny. Though she wasn't really in any position to be fighting she still was gathering information so she could learn more about what had happened during the terrorist attack on Windgrace. </s>"
85,"<s>[INST] So good to see you again, Ranathia. Said a voice out of nowhere only to reveal itself to be a man in their elderly years who came over to greet Ranathia. The man looked over toward the person who accompanied, ""You didn't say you'd be accompanied by anyone, Ranathia. Who this strapping young lad?""
""Professor Langton, don't get such weird ideas. I'm not that kind of person and you know it."" Ranathia said sincerely as she denounced any kind of talk that gave the impression that Mithos and her were seeing each other.
Professor Langton chuckled at Ranathia's comment knowing it was the same way she had acted when he used to tease her about helping one of the boys in a school she used to attend. He knew it was strange since Ranathia didn't really have a strong attraction to the opposite sex and actually loathed the male gender quite a bit. ""C'mon Ranathia, you're not getting any younger. Don't you think a lonely beautiful maiden like you should have handsome man to sweep you off your feet by now?""
Ranathia shook her [/INST] head as she wanted to get all this teasing nonsense by her. She knew Langton had not changed a bit who continued to tease her about her phobia to no end. ""Mithos, this is Professor Langton. He is my source for information."" Ranathia introduced to Mithos as Langton reached out to shake Mithos hand.
_________________________________________________________________________________
""Yeah, that..."" She said as she wanted to forget about someone getting the better of her who was very skilled at using a sword. She was probably the most notable swordsman since Vandalin The Flash Strike. She earned herself the nickname Death Flash, because in a flash of her blade she had killed her enemies without flinching.
""I might as well tell you what happened. The castle was attacked by terrorists if you have not read about it yet or heard about it from gossip and I was blown away when a demon used a kamekaze attack on me in hope of killing me."" Reala commented even though deep down she wanted to forget that incident ever happened. </s>"
86,"<s>[INST] Is that so? Mithos pondered ""I'm not sure if I should be furious or overjoyed; despite what they have planned for her, they are giving me a chance to rescue her. Do you have any idea when that ship will be here?"" He asked the Professor 'I certainly hope he does. I would really rather not have to stake out the location myself.' He added in his head. He started going over any sort of perpetration he could make in his head.
---
""Oh, bye then, and thanks"" Danny said to Reala as he picked up the tip. Walking back to his place i [/INST] n the kitchen, he passed by Mr. Pucci and said ""girls are so confusing. Did any of that make sense to you?""
Chuckling a little bit, Mr. Pucci ruffled up Danny's hair and said ""Danny, unlocking the mysteries of the opposite sex is just one of the many hurdles on the path of life. As you grow older, many of their strange ways will begin to make sense to you.""
""If you say so. Although to be honest, I'm not sure if I do want to understand girls. I might go mad from the revelation"" Danny replied before went back into the kitchen </s>"
87,"<s>[INST] The ship should be here next week at night. The Professor answered Mithos question as he turned his attention back toward Ranathia. He still had to tell her what he learned from the lone researcher who survived the ruins. ""Ranathia, I wish you would reconsider exploring those ruins. I hear a very powerful beast is guarding them and that many researchers had lost their lives to it. The lone researcher told me it is a beast that is unaffected by regular weapons.""
""A Ragnanite Demon then?"" Ranathia questioned as she had a pretty good idea it had to be one, because only a Ragnanite Demon c [/INST] ould be unaffected by attacks, because they appear in the Material Plane but still are in the Spectral Plane where they cannot be harmed by physical weapons. She then continued on when she knew what it was possibly protecting, ""If there's a Ragnanite Demon there then it must be protecting a Chaos Rune or an Egis. If we leave it unchecked it will just get stronger.""
""Yes Ranathia, but you are no condition to be fighting. I know you won't lisen to me since you're as stubborn as your brother, but do please be careful."" Langton warned since he was very concerned about Ranathia's well-being. </s>"
88,"<s>[INST] See you later then, Mithos. Ranathia said as she took the time to wave to him goodbye. Even though the Professor didn't want Ranathia to go to the ruins she wasn't about to let a Ragnanite Demon from stopping her. Besides, the beast would need to put down eventually otherwise it would wreak havoc on the city. She also said her short piece toward Professor Langton before she told him goodbye as well returning to her car. She wasn't sure where to start or how to deal with this beast. If it was wiping out bands of researchers then it must be a pretty nasty monster.
""Still jumping into danger, eh?"" A familiar voice said to her from behind and when she turned ar [/INST] ound she noticed it was Lucent. She had no idea Lucent had snuck into her car and when he did and caught her by surprised she chew him out not to be sneaking up on her like that.
""Lucent, how long have you been there?"" Ranathia questioned as she turned around to face him from her seat eye to eye.
Jumping into the passenger's seat, ""For the whole duration of your talk with Professor Langton. Surprised the guy still likes to stick his head out where it might get cut off. He's got guts, that's for sure."" Lucent answered as he gestured toward Ranathia while thinking about some thoughts in his head from earlier that he was trying to understand in better picture. </s>"
89,"<s>[INST] You're still planning on going to those ruins, aren't you? Lucent remarked as he could see that Ranathia really wasn't in any condition to be going anywhere at the moment. Judging by how she looked her face looked very pale. He couldn't help but be concerned over her well-being.
Ranathia nodded at Lucent not really say a word. She didn't really know how to tell Lucent that she wasn't going to listen to his advice about not going. She tried to hire a bodyguard, but the one she tried to hired accused of her forcing them to go with her which did not sit well with her. Ranathia wasn't really the kind of person who would just force people to go with her. Almost her entire life after she grew too old for her brother to care she had been taking care of herself and this was no different. She wasn't about to let a chance of getting to destroy a threat and learn more about ancient ruins pass up. She hoped that searching the ruins might give her an idea of who she really was and what kind of people she descen [/INST] ded from.
""All right."" Lucent said as he stepped out of her car and closed the door. His last words to her was for her to take care of herself before he jumped up into the air and onto a building where he eventually fell out of sight.
____________________________________________________________________________
Meanwhile Meira had finally arrived at her school which was packed with lots of kids. She was outside the school just as you walk up toward the doors where she saw lots of kids hanging around. She also saw two familiar sights when she observed where she saw both Nathan and Alice were present. ""Surprised to see you here, Nathan. Did you decide to learn something after all?"" She laughed as she then turned her attention toward Alice gesturing toward her a simple hello, ""Morning Alice."" Meira added which she probably knew Alice was finding it very strange that someone of her status was associating with the likes of Alice. She didn't really care since you didn't have to be wealthy to be her friend. </s>"
90,"<s>[INST] It was a weird month for Alice, she was caught up in the attack at the coronation, she was told that several unbelievable stories were actually true and to top it all, she now has a somewhat friendly relationship with the Princess. ""Ah, good morning Prin...Meira,"" Alice said to Meira, giving the latter a stiff nod. The princess was an o [/INST] dd person in Alice's eyes, she's a noble but didn't show much of how the usual nobles act. She knew there would be exceptions among the nobles, but for the highest ranking noble to be one was a confusing matter to understand. However, Meira also knew about Whizzle, which mean that she's one of the few person that Alice could speak with. </s>"
91,"<s>[INST] Oh! That's alright! Alice quickly replied. ""I didn't mean to impose after all. But if you think she could answer, then I'm willing to meet her and ask..""
She then looked at the commotion that was happening and her expression turned sour. Her school was fairly lenient when it comes to uniform, only having them mandatory in [/INST] certain days but there were always some people who had problems with it, especially those who likes to flaunt their wealth. Sure, the uniforms tend to use skirts that is too short than what she liked, but they usually don't cry over if she wear shorts underneath.
""Ugh, and I hoped it would've been a quiet day."" She scowled. </s>"
92,"<s>[INST] Alice gave a grateful nod to Meira for the name. Although something about the name seems very familiar. Where did she hear that name before? However, her dive on memory ha [/INST] ve to wait as Nathan looked at the Meira look-alike the ""wrong"" way and had attracted her ire. Oh, she's the angsty noble type. I hope it would start already, she thought. </s>"
93,"<s>[INST] As the students filled the building taking their seats on the benches as they awaited to have their names announced, both Meira and Reala remained outside. Reala didn't really want to participate, but she found out something interesting that would help toward her initial goal so she decided to make this exception while she knew Meira was forced to attend so she could learn how to become a people person which was the direct opposite of what Reala wanted to become. Sure the fancy treatment and pampering sounded nice, but she wasn't about to give up her character for all of that.
""Aren't you coming, Reala?"" Meira asked as she had remained behind while all the other students entered the building. She could notice that something was on Reala's mind, but she couldn't quite contemplate what it was. She also was thinking about how she regretted taking a leader stance. Sure she was a leader, but if it involved having to attend boring classes she would have rather passed on the idea, but it was too [/INST] late. She had already engraved it on her slate and there was no turning back now. She whispered to herself while staring at the ground, ""Man, this just plain sucks. I never imagined being a leader would require so much training. Had I known I would have never agreed to it in the first place.""
Reala let out a small smile as she walked over and placed her hand around Meira. ""It's all right, sister. I suppose I will help you bear that responsibility together. After all."" Reala paused for a moment as her smile grew larger before returning to her normal facial expression. ""We are sisters. As sisters, we must look out for one another!""
""Really?"" Meira questioned surprised by Reala's response that took some breath out of her from the shock.
Reala didn't even answer her, but she did give a nod with a larger smile on her face to confirm what she just said as fact. Meira gave her sister a big hug out of happiness when she learned Reala would help her with this burden that had been eating away at her. </s>"
94,"<s>[INST] A few weeks had passed with some forward progress in breaking Fenrir, but a man dressed in mostly black wearing what looked to be a black duster had come to confront the man who was currently in possession of the Providence Breaker. The guards said toward the head of the WW Division leader, “Introducing the owner of the largest energy organizations in existence, Sir Sentius. His research into energy is unparalleled and thanks to his influence we have made new revolutions in our studies of how exactly this Universe came to be. He is the CEO of Psychosis, the largest energy supplier in existence. He would like to talk to you about what he could do for you.”
“As you know I am the owner of Psygnosis, one of the largest energy suppliers in the entire galaxy. I am here to make a rather interesting deal that benefits us both.” The man said as he dismissed the guards. He was curious what he could learn from this person and how they could help him learn more about Taru and her connection to a special existence which drew all of his interest. I don’t really care about his research into this werewolf. What I want to know is his werewolf’s relationship with the Holy Mother and what he knows about Mother. I must know more about Antitypes and their purpose. I have to know, because this could lead toward the possible creation of an entity just like Cinis if not better. He thought as he grinned to himself.
The old man, Reek, sighed and responded, “I am a scientist, not a bureaucrat, go bother one of them with your petty business deals and corporate espionage.”
“To be honest, I’m only interested in meeting Taru. I won’t keep her from what she has planned, but I want a chance to meet this girl. I would also like to know what Fenrir knows about Meira. I have no interest in your creations. Just knowledge they might have which may prove useful in our research on the Rune of Origin. He may have knowledge about Antitypes which would be essential for our own research. That is all I want. In return, I may help you with your research as compensation for at least letting me meet her.” Sentius said as he dropped the formality and business nonsense and got exactly to the point. He needed to know if Fenrir might have heard from Meira the answer to The Key that they were missing. Also if he came across what possible could be an Eve clone named Lenna which Luther created. Anyone that came into contact with these Antiypes could prove useful in discovering the secrets about their existence.
“Fine. I give you permission to speak to Taru and Fenrir, but entirely because I want to get out of my office.” Reek snarked. He was tempted to simply kill these people, but he had the feeling they were more powerful than they originally let on, and the Cimmerians wouldn’t be to happy with that executive decision.
“Wise decision… You do not want to see what I am capable of, old fool.” He said as his hand glowed an ominous gold color for a second before dissipating as Reek’s men lead the man toward the place they were holding Fenrir first. He wanted to extract as much knowledge from Fenrir before he came into contact with Taru. That way he could better feel the relationship Taru has with Fenrir, the voice that speaks to her and Meira. “Using unstable energy pockets and trick magic to prevent people from escaping... Not bad though if I pass my energy through another dimension and release it directly on my target I don’t have to worry about such primitive methods. This being the reason I find boundary manipulation the most interesting aspect in the field of magic, because the problem with most forms of magic is they have backdoors just like this trick. No matter, I will play along with this little charade of yours. Perhaps I can learn something that is actually useful from it from my experience to it.”
They lead him to the cell then let him in the cell where Fenrir was being held where he approached the figure. “Introductions are pointless so I will get right to the point. There is much we can learn from one another. I have no interest in Reek’s dealings with you nor any interests the Cimmeria Empire has with you. Though I could provide you with an opportunity to escape and for you to take Taru far away from here. Before I do that, you have to do something for me. All I want to know is what you know about Meira when you came into contact with her? What is her relationship with you? I also want to know if the voice inside Taru ever tried to speak to you and if she did what did she say?”
Meanwhile Taru was discussing with Anayame what they should do. She saw the object that Reek provided them though she wanted to know why he was so interested in helping her escape. She didn’t know whether to escape or not since her original’s friend Fenrir was still being held captive. She regretted every word she said toward Fenrir and hated herself for saying it. Sure she did get Anayame back, but at what price? She might have just severed what relationship Meira had with the beast and any hope of light shining inside its void for a heart. She also knew that Eve was having no luck in convincing Fenrir to listen to her. “Something inside me, Anayame says I’m not doing the right thing. I feel so horrible for what I’ve done because her feelings are just getting stronger which is starting to complicate things for me.”
Anayame reached over and gripped Taru’s hand nodding. Anayame unlike Taru had short hair which was shoulder length. She wore a plaid skirt which was mostly green and yellow with white square figurines on it. She also wore a white vest over top her blue blouse and a pair of white thigh highs along with a pair of white sneakers. “I want to save him too, Taru. I saw how lonely he looks and it pains me to see someone that way.”
Fenrir’s cell, while behind a lock door, did not look like a cage, but instead a very fancy two-room hotel, a luxurious bedroom and a bathroom. Fenrir just laid down on his stomach, a pillar covering his face. Whenever he heard the stranger’s voice, he [/INST] simply raised his hand, making a very rude gesture among werewolves.
“Let me ask you a question? Do you wish to escape or not? I can make this worthwhile for the both of us. I will also allow you to be reunited with Meira, but this is the last time I will ask. What do you know about Meira and what is her connection with you? Also, tell me anything you know about Taru or the voice that speaks to her?” This time Sentius shifted his voice to a more of I’m not in the mood for my time to be wasted type of tone. This time he was a bit more sincere about what he was asking and it was the last time he was going to ask. He had far better things to do than waste his time with talking to a brick wall. He could just access what he wanted to know from Taru since she came into contact with Fenrir.
Fenrir seemed to think for a moment, pausing for a few moments without moving. Or, that was just what it appeared to be, in truth, he just fell asleep which became evident after his first snore.
“Have it your way then.” Sentius said as he turned around signaled to the guards and left the room. “Tell Reek I won’t be returning. If he has any information he wants to provide me with then send it to my research division. I’m done wasting my time here.” He concluded as he walked away from that room and started for the room where they were holding Taru captive. He signaled toward the guards to open the door where he got an immediate action from Taru and her sister Anayame.
Taru immediately turned her attention toward the door as she was surprised that someone came to visit her aside from Reek and his goon squad. She also recognized who the person was which made her shift into a more serious mood, “What do you want?” She said not pleased to see the man again.
The man walked and introduced himself, but neither Taru nor her sister Anayame were pleased to see him. He walked over and took a seat in one of the chair then focused all his attention on the two girls. “Taru, what did you learn from Fenrir? Does he know anything about Meira that he should not know? Should he find out the secret of her ancestry it may provide problems for me in the future. I certainly don’t want that cult Reek is from getting their hands on the Rune of Origin let alone any of the Antitypes especially you and Lenna.” He grinned as he snapped his fingers which brought her into a trance which was under his complete control.
“Master Sentius, he knows nothing about the Rune of Origin. He also hasn’t learned anything about Meira’s lineage aside from the fact she’s a princess. By now, everyone should be able to be able to draw that conclusion.
He’s such a naive fellow. He thinks I’m Meira when I’m not. How could my original be friends with someone so vulgar? It’s absurd I tell you. Do you wish for him to be eliminated?” Taru asked with no control over her emotions or body. It seemed that her self-awareness didn’t interfere either.
“No, that won’t be necessary. Perhaps I can keep him alive and use him toward getting Meira to reveal her power. If that fool Reek gets in my way or that cult I will have their existence nullified. Should they push me I shall show them what I’m truly capable of and why I am the Father of Magic.” Sentius threatened as he thought about what his next move would be. Sentius was very renown for his skill at magic. His magical skills surpassed everyone and he knew every back door to every spell hence why he relies on his Boundary Manipulation and Dimension Magic which has no equal. “Your purpose here has been served, Taru. I shall transport you to the continent Holyoke in Windgrace’s capital so you can fulfill your next task.”
“What is my next task?” Taru questioned as she was very curious to learn what it was. She took a drink from her wine that was on the table while she waited for Sentius to answer he question. She wondered what kind of place Windgrace was?
“Your next task is to confront Meira and erase any memories she has of Fenrir. I want her to completely forget about that fool. I cannot allow her to be placing herself in danger when she is needed to complete my next task. Hopefully Ranathia’s run with the ruin will confirm my theory about her being The Key. If that’s true, I am one step closer from achieving my ultimate goal.” Sentius grinned as he prepared his hand which had a mysterious golden glow on his hand. It was time for Taru and Anayame to leave Cimmeria and confront their next target which was Meira. “Eventually I’ll eliminate Reek so that the knowledge about Antitypes and the Rune of Origin are simply forgotten. After that, as long as Fenrir stays out of my way I will not have to destroy him.” With those words Sentius pulled himself and the two other girls into a pocket dimension he created called The Void. He then in a flash of light sent the two on their mission which was in Windgrace as he snapped his finger bringing Taru back to her normal state while he returned to finish what he had started.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A flash a light appeared and out of it two girls appeared a room that had a blonde angelic man in it. Taru knew that Sentius probably didn't project their trajectory perfectly and that his aiming was a bit off. why else would they end up in someone's house only to recognize that it was Meira house since she could sense Meira's essence in the place. Another girl accompanied her for the trip. The hand maidens were all stunned and shocked at what they just saw. They could have sworn that they sent Meira to school. ""Heheh, um well..."" Taru paused a bit embarrassed to barge into Meira's manor unannounced. It was a bit rude and very intruding to do so. Especially when she looked just like Meira.
One of the hand maidens said toward Mithos who was reading a book in the room, ""Mithos, tell me that I'm seeing things?"" She questioned still not able to understand why she was seeing the princess right in front of her who appeared out of a flash of light. </s>"
95,"<s>[INST] I apologize for their abrupt interruptions. A voice said as a man stepped out of a void he created in the area before closing it. This man wore a black duster which covered most up his lower and middle portions of his body and his hood made it hard to see his face. You could see two dark blue eyes peering out from the darkness inside his hood. ""I was trying to rescue them from the Cimmeria Empire, because they are clones created for the purpose of destruction and somehow my transportation spell misfired and they ended up here.""
""Sentius..."" Taru said as she had regained [/INST] full control of her mind and she again was very cautious of the man. She knew that this man had forcefully taken control of her earlier and managed to suppress the entity inside her.
Stepping in front of Taru Anayame faced Sentius with a straight face and fire in her eyes. ""Can't you just leave Taru alone? You've already put her through enough as it is. I wish you would just stop trying to help us and leave us alone!"" She barked as she put her arms out in a cross to bar his path from Taru. ""The only reason you care is because we were born differently than other people!"" </s>"
96,"<s>[INST] Alice sat impatiently in the room as she waited until the screening starts. She already knew where she would end up anyway as it's the only option for her, that makes the screening moot but it's mandatory to attend and therefore she has to stay for the duration. Noticing that Nathan was similarly looking bored as he wait, [/INST] Alice decided to converse with him.
""Um, hey, Nathan,"" she started. ""You're the princess' bodyguard right? How long have you been at it? Being a bodyguard I mean, I thought all bodyguards are older and you don't look much older than I am, but... after what I'm told, I just can't think age corelate with your appearance..."" </s>"
97,"<s>[INST] I have no interest in words that do not prove useful for my motives. Unlike most of you mortals, I have no driven logic toward anger so easily. Mule's bray and fool's talk, but the wiseman listens not. You did give me something that I could use so I'll compliment you for that. Sentius answered back in a very cold tone as he opened the door and walked out it. He had sufficient knowledge and now it was time to look for the Academy of Magical Arts and Research Division so that he may finally come into contact with Meira. Sentius made his appearance go transparent though you could still clearly see him like he was still in their plane.
Taru looked at Mithos where she shook her head in disbelief about him not knowing where the school was breaking free from Anayame's grip. ""You're lying and I can sense it from your energy. Your negative energy just became stronger..."" But she was interrupted by Anayame who again grabbed Taru and pulled her away before she made more of a fool of herself. ""Taru, he doesn't need to know that. You sometimes need to keep your special powers you have to yourself. Speak at a more convenient time."" Anayame added where Taru simply though Anayame was acting like a parent or guardian.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""Reala, did you sense that?"" Meira asked as she stopped from entering the building when she suddenly felt an emergence in the area. She could tell that there were three very strong energy readings, but she couldn't quite get a fix on their locations. Meira had no idea if thes [/INST] e people were friend or foe which made her concern grow even stronger.
Reala turned around to grab Meira, but suddenly stopped when she could also feel the same thing Meira could. She could not only sense very strong energy readings in the area, but also she thought she heard some thoughts that were not her own. Reala couldn't really explain whose thoughts they were or where they came from.
Reala simply peered down the white concrete steps that weren't in perfect condition as they stretched their way downward toward the bottom. It was a very steep drop and quite a slide should you lose your step she noticed. While examining that specific area she could not see anyone or feel anyone in that area.
While she observed the surrounding area, she heard it once again the voice that contacted her awhile back saying things she simply didn't understand. Again it was mentioning some ""Seed of Eve"" which did not compute for Reala. She had no idea what that was or what they were even talking about. Reala could only simple think to herself mimicking the same words in a very low tone mumble Seed of Eve...
Meira looked at Reala seeing that something was bothering her. Knowing Reala's nature she knew full and well that she wouldn't tell her simply what it was since she didn't want others to get involved. Meira couldn't help feeling concern for her own sister ans she could feel her heart starting to thump louder and louder like if her sister was calling her for help. Then she also heard the very same voice say the samething which drew her face away from Reala and simply drove into complete confusion. </s>"
98,"<s>[INST] Meira once again examined her surroundings, but she didn't see anyone in sight. She could still hear a voice saying the same phrase. Though it didn't sound like the evil voice who tried to take her over. Her confusion grew stronger every time it mentioned the very same phrase. Somehow she sensed another presence in her mind, but that's impossible. She thought because she had never in her life felt this way before. It didn't really scare her at all or make her remember the nightmares that haunt her. Meira wasn't sure if she should seek out the presence or not. If she missed the enroll exam they might appoint someone as her personal guardian to see that she goes to school. That bothered her though her curiosity grew due to the fact she wanted to know how this person was able to affect her thoughts.
Reala who was also confused noticed that Meira was still in her mesmerized state like she didn't know what was going on. Like Meira, she was also uninformed about what she was feeling though she did realize that she was connected with Meira's mind even though she didn't have an explanation. Now she felt two more presences in her mind that she did not know. Normally, her power would repel anything that was malicious; however, neither presences shown intent toward harming her or trying to force her into submission. ""Who would influence our minds in such a way? It's like whomever these people are that we are sensing understand what we are feeling. Also, this voice I keep hearing is just unexplainable. I've never heard her before so who exactly is she?"" Reala could only question since thinking about it only made her even more confused. Right now it was like a thick veil of mist had overlapped her thoughts and she just couldn't pierce the barrier it was projecting.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meanwhile inside the building, one of the people's at the desk starting calling for names. They went by student by student according to how they were separated classification wise. Still sorting through the S Class students the attendant called for the name Meira Rystaliuskal, but whenever they called for Meira there was absolutely no answer. There were a lot of students in the building, some seated while others standing talking to each other. There were also a few others who sat alone isolated from everyone else. The building was very crowded, but finding a girl with pink hair should be easy. They didn't have many in attendance who had pink hair.
""MEIRA RYSTALIUSK [/INST] AL! CALLING MEIRA RYSTALIUSKAL! PLEASE REPORT TO THE FRONT DESK IMMEDIATELY!"" The attendant said over the loud speaker, but still there was no answer. The attendant grumbled to themselves as they were growing very impatient of waiting for her. ""Where could have that child ran off to?""
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""This place is sure a lot cleaner than the Cimmeria Empire."" Taru said as she explored the sights the capital of Windgrace had to offer. There were lots of tall buildings and floating contraptions in the sky. She saw that these floating contraptions emitted some kind of energy which formed some kind of barrier. ""I wonder, do they use Magitek?"" Taru pondered as a thought as she placed her index finger at her lip. The girl was rather curious and continued to look at those objects as various people passed her by.
Sentius continued to look to have his eyes closed looking like he was concentrating. Anayame was watching him, but knew it was never a good idea to interrupt him when he was meditating. He didn't show he was irritated, but she could see it on his face that it made him angry when you did. She decided to let him do what he was doing while exploring the various sights with Anayame. It was better than having to deal with a very ice cold stare that gave you the chills when you angered Sentius. Though she couldn't help but wonder why that man with wings earlier lied to them? Strange, why would that man lie for her sake? I didn't really sense any kind of bond between the two? ""Heh, some people are just weird I guess..."" She said softly as she sighed. While she was able to sigh she breathed in the clean fresh air that Windgrace had to offer. It was a lot more refreshing than the suffocating environment that Cimmeria offered. She didn't understand how people could live in such a place. It was like it sucked the life right out of your body.
""All these people are interfering with me getting a direct fix on Meira's location."" Sentius mumbled to himself softly as he showed an air of irritation in his voice just by how it sounded. The vibe kind of gave both Taru and Anayame an uneasy feeling. They were hoping that he wouldn't do anything rash that would draw a lot of attention. There was no need to kill people needlessly just because they provided somewhat of a hindrance. Momentarily he opened one eye and with a reassuring look reminded the two, ""You don't need to worry. I have no interest in wasting my energy destroying such fragile beings."" </s>"
99,"<s>[INST] That's because he's not human. A voice said out of nowhere only to reveal itself as Stellvia. Stellvia had changed her appearance to look like the school girl where she wore a white shirt, white socks, a black skirt and white tennis shoes. From the skirt to the shirt the girl's wore she knew that mortals had such strange fashion sense. She then peered over the boy while pondering the thought that Nathan was trying to hide he truly was. How long are you going to continue to lie to yourself, boy? If any harm comes to Rana while she is sealing your power you might not want to know what I'll do. She then focused all her attention on Alice once again. ""Though I must say this is the first time I thought so highly of a mortal. It's your innocent nature that allures me into curiosity. I think if I stay close to you I might find out the true nature of your kind. Never thought I'd allow a mortal into my void of a heart, but you have certainly surprised me, Alice.""
Back at the desk, the attendant had waited long enough where she stuck her head outside the booth and yelled so everyone could hear as her voice filled the entire room, ""DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE THAT BLASTED MEIRA IS? I'M GETTING TIRED OF WAITING FOR THAT FOOLISH CHI [/INST] LD!!!"" Where the students each looked at each other and around then shrugged their shoulders. A few others just shook their heads or just ignored the attendant completely.
One of the teachers watched by and thought that Nathan was fraternizing with one of the school girls. He walked immediately over toward Nathan and whacked him on the back with a yard stick. This man was a very heavy set man with a rather unattractive looking face and geeky glasses. ""Flirting with the females is prohibited! That's one demerit for you, Nathan Alduin! I knew you'd be a worthless delinquent piece of trash that was dumped on our doorstep."" He then pointed his yardstick toward a sign that showed an o with a line through it with a male sitting with a female. ""Are you blind that you cannot see the regulations in this building, boy! Judging by how smart you look you're probably too stupid even to know how to read. I think I should add you to my shit list.""
He then immediately turned his position to face Alice where he gave her a very scary looking facial expression, ""Shouldn't you missy be with the girls? Now get to it! I don't have all day! A demerit for you also."" He said as other students knew how much of a jerk that teacher really was. </s>"
100,"<s>[INST] Ah, I don't... Alice started before yelping in surprise when the stick struck Nathan. She looked at the teacher and then the sign that was being pointed at. She blinked in astonishment, the sign wasn't there the last time she attended, was it a special rule made because the princess were going to attend to avoid suitors from harassing her? The girl remembered the princess complaining that she didn't look forward to marriage at all.
Still, she sho [/INST] uld've noticed it sooner, they wouldn't get in trouble if she had.
Looking apologetically towards Nathan, Alice opened her mouth to speak her apology but was stilled by the teacher's malicious glare as Nathan stood up and left the hall to look for Meira. ""Ah, yes sir,"" Alice nervously nodded when the teacher turned his attention to her. Slowly, she moved over to another group with familiar faces where she was greeted with teasing over her demerit. </s>"
101,"<s>[INST] A familiar voice called out to Reala as it laughed about her sudden weakness. When it pierced Reala's mind her pupil's grew very large and fear pulsed through her entire body. As she trembled in fear, she couldn't believe it with her own eyes even if she wanted to refuse to acknowledge it. ""You're weak, Reala. Looks like that injury has taken a lot out of you. Making Meira an easier target for me.""
""DAMN YOU!"" Reala barked as she materialized her sword into her hands as she tried to charge the enemy, but her attack was sloppy where they easily avoided it. Reala fell to one knee embracing her wound which throbbed, because she had just gone and aggravated her own injury. ""You two, just get to class. I'll deal with this even if it is the end of me!""
The figure that confronted them was completely robed in black. His face was even covered with his outfit and only you could see his two eyes which pierced through the darkness of the hood he wore over his head. Meira saw that Reala was in absolutely no condition to battle. Knowing that she looked over toward Reala and yelled at her with a very concerning look filling her entire face, ""Reala, you're hurt! There's no way you can fight this person on your own! He'd kill you before you even got a hit on him!""
Despite how aggressive Reala was, the figure showed no sign of attacking either girls. This bothered Reala to no end and confused [/INST] Meira not understanding why the person was there in the first place. A shady figure appearing out of nowhere and Reala spotting his shadow. Not only that, confronted my sister and calling her out on her weakness? Seems pretty suspicious to me. Meira thought to herself as she noticed Nathan had reached out to grab her. She slapped his hand away then pointed at her sister who was knelt down on one knee and a very dangerous figure that stood right behind her. ""I understand your concern about my aunt, Nathan but this is not the time for that. If we don't stop Reala, she'll do something really stupid!""
""YOU SHOULD BE DEAD!"" Reala yelled as her anger fueled the rage she felt inside. Despite having so much strength, her physical body just didn't have the strength to endure. ""I'LL KILL YOU!!!"" Reala yelled as she tried to rise to her feet, but the pain was just unbearable that her body just couldn't take it where it reacted on its own. ""Stupid body, I command you to do as I say. I don't give a damn about my well-being!""
""HAHAHAHAH!"" The figure laughed as he began to grin at Reala. Even though Reala was being so hostile, the figure showed no sign of attacking her or any aggression. ""It's your physical bounds that hold you back, Reala. That is why you're so pathetic! You'll never realize your true potential like that! A burden you have to protect closely or it will make you regret it."" </s>"
102,"<s>[INST] The figure closed his eyes and grinned as he saw Nathan pushed Reala away which he could see irritated her. He examined Nathan closely as he measured his energy readings. ""Interesting..."" They said as their grin grew larger and with their mouth closed laughed diabolically. ""So you're The Sentinel. I didn't think I'd run into you so quickly, but do you honestly think someone as puny as you could provide as a sword and shield for those two girls?""
Reala was pushed backward which only fueled her anger even more. Meira sighed as she nodded at Mithos grabbing her sister's hand and pulling her away from the scene. The two fled up the stairs where Reala's eyes burned with fire, ""I NEVER ASKED YOU TO HELP ME!"" Were the only words that came out as Meira used her other hand to cover her mouth with to prevent her from saying a [/INST] nything else selfish. ""JUST DON'T PUSH YOURSELF TOO HARD, NATHAN!"" Meira answered back as she towed her sister along with toward the entrance of the building. Reala was still angry as she expressed it with her facial expression as she was finally pulled into the building out of harm's way.
""So, you want to fight me? What do you think you would accomplish even if you fought me? I already killed both girls mothers and you would just be adding to their pain should you fall. Why don't you just retreat for now, because I didn't come to fight anyone."" The figure grinned since he had no interest in fighting anyone today. There was no one really around who piqued his interest and the only person that was worth fighting was down for the count. He wasn't about to fight her like a coward who would kick a man when they're down. </s>"
103,"<s>[INST] I'll answer your question if you can defeat me. I don't mean here. The figure paused as he threw him a flyer announcing the school was holding a martial arts tournament. The flyer said on it The Gaelan World Dark Martial Arts and Combat Tournament saying that each school would be enlisting entrants for it. ""If you can make it all the way to the finals to fight me and actually defeat me then I'll answer your questions. Until then, I will leave you to think about what I meant by my words. That is if a chump like you is bold enough to enter a tournament that may cost you your life."" The figure finished as a sudden black smoke surrounded him which made it [/INST] hard to see. He eventually disappeared as the smoke began to dissipate. There was no sign of the individual other than the footprints left on the ground that they left.
""Oh by the way, I was also the one who killed your parents Nozdormu and Ysera, Netharion Alduin. Hahahah, it was fun to watch your mother desperately beg for your life before I killed her. You should have seen the rage on your father's face before I killed him too. All of them wanting me to spare your pathetic life. AHAHAHAHAH!!! Their blood was most enjoyable quenching my thirst."" Even though he had disappeared he let Nathan hear those words in attempt to break or at least shake him up. </s>"
104,"<s>[INST] When Nathan returned to inside the building, Reala stood up with a very fiery angry expression on her face marching over quickly toward where Nathan was. She then rose her hand up and slapped him very hard across the face, because using magic inside the school probably wasn't a good idea. ""HOW DARE YOU!"" She screamed off the top of her lungs as Meira could only watch as her sister was obviously very upset.
""Why? Why did you interfere? Stop helping me! I can take care of myself. I'm not some poor defenseless girl and I never asked you to help me in the first place! Just leave me alone, okay? I can take care of myself."" Reala said as you could see her eyes had started to water from the facial expression she was giving Nathan. It was obvious by how she reacted that she was a very lonely person who did not appreciate the company of o [/INST] thers when it came to her problems. Ever since she was a child, she had fended for herself and never relied on anyone else. But that had changed when two people helped her when she never wanted their help in the first place. She tried to walk away but fell to one knee as she held where she was wounded cringing in pain since once again she had aggravated her wound.
""Reala, don't you think that was a little harsh?"" Meira questioned as she had immediate concern for her sister who had been wounded awhile ago. She knew Reala was pushing herself if the wound hadn't healed already. Her sister was very stubborn and didn't listen to anyone when it came to herself.
Meira then noticed someone at the desk was yelling for her name and saw the woman was getting impatient where she chuckled with her eyes closed, ""I'll be right back... Heheheh."" </s>"
105,"<s>[INST] Reala could only look at Nathan as she listened to what he said while all the students retrieved their books and study guides for their classes and informed what district they would be in. While that was going on Reala could only think for a moment until they called her turn. She walked over and retrieved her materials then walked over to where Nathan was standing. She couldn't sit down otherwise it would be seen as fraternizing with the boys.
The thought of a teacher yelling at her didn't bother her where She stared down at the ground then swept her hand across her face to prevent tears from falling down her face. She could not let Nathan see that she was getting emotional. It she did, it would be a weakness her enemy could use against her. Staying strong she shook off the tremendous pressure from the pain she felt from her loneliness and trying to use it further to act like she wasn't even hurt. She then tilted her head with a fiery look of a serious nature filled her entire face. She could feel the strength of that feeling all over her body as it pulsed through her veins giving her a new refreshed confidence after all that was said. ""Look, I understand what you're saying, but you cannot convince me to think otherwise. This is my problem so just stay out of it. You have no idea how I feel so don't even think you know! How could you? Unlike you, I had to fend for myself when my foster parents died. How could you possibly understand what it is like to have to go through what I've been through?"" Reala paused for a moment as she saw memories she shared with her foster parents. Ones that she couldn't forget, especially the ones that kept them close together as one nicely knitted family.
""Reala, don't be like this! Everyone needs friends to rely on!"" Meira tried to remind her, but Reala shook her head in disbelief as she turned her attention away from Meira. Meira knew Nathan only wanted to help her sister and she wanted to assist too, but Reala's do it herself ego stood in the way of trying to grow a closer relationship toward her.
When Meira said she would h [/INST] elp Reala and held at her hand, Reala slapped it away in disgust. When Reala slapped Meira's hand away she looked at her with a hurt look on her face. ""I was only trying to help, Reala. You don't have to be so damn stubborn. We are sisters after all? Doesn't that mean anything?""
Reala immediately turn her back on Meira and gave her a hmph expression crossing her arms. ""You're a Princess, Meira. Unlike you I don't need anyone to protect me. Since you are a natural born leader you need everyone to protect you. Now just stop bothering me already!""
With that said Reala walked over back toward where the girls were supposed to be as she awaited the announcement there train was going to arrive soon. She didn't mind being in the same class as Meira, but she didn't want anything to do with Nathan. She saw him as an obstacle who could become a problem if she didn't keep an eye on him. She turned around and her words rang a very serious vibe when they pierced the air in the room, ""Stop trying to think you understand me, Nathan. At least I can control my power unlike you who needs someone to hold your hand! Now you need my aunt to hold your hand. You're so pathetic! You can't do anything on your own. You're so dependent. Why don't you just shut up already!"" She paused for a moment as she pointed her finger at him where she continued, ""Get in my way, Nathan and I will kill you! If you don't think I'm serious then just try me. I will do what I feel needs to be done. I don't need you telling me who and who I can't fight. You aren't my father and you certainly aren't my damn brother!"" 
""REALA!!!"" Meira yelled at her certainly offended by what her sister had just said about her friend. ""Don't you think that was brutally harsh?""
""It's not my problem if he can't handle the truth."" Reala shrugged as she continued to walk away where she returned to the wall she was leaning against. When she left, Meira could tell that Reala did not mean those words and she was just angry and frustrated. There was no way her sister would say such a thing even if she didn't want help from others. </s>"
106,"<s>[INST] Why do you continue to get in my face? You don't give a damn about me so just leave me alone, okay? You have my sister to take care of. Protect her and stop trying to get close to me. I don't need friends. All they do is weigh you down. Reala said as she turned around with fire burning in her eyes. The passion burning on Reala's face was strong which almost drove her toward attacking Nathan. He was really pissing her off and she was tired of listening to his excuses. ""Don't give me an excuse to let you help me, because I don't want your help. I do not understand why you just do not get it!""
""I will not al [/INST] low you to trash talk one of my own so..."" Reala gave up a deep sigh as she placed her palm on Nathan's torso then concentrated her energy until it formed a glyph which shattered the one that was inside Nathan's body as it became shards of energy before dissipating. ""I don't expect any thanks. There, I undone the seal for you? Happy now? Now leave me alone already!""
""Reala..."" Meira called Reala's name as she was quite lost on what just happened. She thought to herself quietly as she tried to put together what she just did. She just broke a very powerful magic seal. I cannot believe my eyes at the moment. </s>"
107,"<s>[INST] Unfortunately for Nathan Reala didn't really care whether he believed her or not. She wasn't about to trust someone who got in her way since she was determined to fulfill her promise she made toward her mother. ""Believe what you want."" Reala paused as she walked by Nathan then turned around to continue, ""I don't really care whether you trust me or not, because I will never trust you after you disgraced me in front of Meira. You can take your trust and put it where the sun doesn't shine. That's what I think of it. Why should I trust you? Just because you saved me? Hah, you just want me to look weak just like any other male who looks at women only for their looks. I am stronger than you and I am capable of more than you. I don't need you. I can do everything myself without your help."" Reala concluded as she pushed Nathan into a wall away from her and decided to go someplace where he wouldn't disturb her. She was tired of listening to his excuses. She was tired of listening to how he didn't trust her or her aunt. Like she cared what he thought. What he thought wouldn't change the fact that man killed her mother in cold blood. It didn't change the fact her mother probably looked down on her for not seizing the opportunity. ""Just stay out of my way from now on. Don't even help me for my sister's sake. You are worthless piece of trash I wa [/INST] nt nothing to do with. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to something I need to do. Do not follow me.""
When she heard him talk about how he was going to fight the man in the martial arts tournament, she turned around and gave him a icy gaze before she just walked away. She decided she would just do what she about to do. Not allowing anyone to stop her nor was she about to listen to anyone for that reason.
""Why can't she understand that she's not alone? Why can't she understand that her well-being affects others? She's so damn stubborn when it comes to herself. When it comes to her motives, it's near next to impossible to sway her mind."" Meira complained as she could only watch Reala walk away. She didn't understand why Reala refused to trust those who tried to help her. She wanted to remind Reala she wasn't alone and that she didn't need to face everything on her own. ""Nathan, Reala didn't mean anything she said. I know it sounds like she did, but she's just angry and very frustrated. Frustrated that she didn't have the strength to overcome her own weaknesses. She sees being injured as a weakness and she is beating herself up over being too weak to overcome the pain she is served by her own recklessness. Please do not think badly of her, she's a good person by heart. It's just that she's very stubborn when it comes to her own health."" </s>"
108,"<s>[INST] I've known Reala since we were children, Nathan. She would always visit me so we could play despite refusing to live with anyone. Ranathia wanted to take her in as her own, but Reala refused saying she didn't want to burden anyone with her problems. Meira paused for a moment as she sighed trying to forget about everything that had happened. Though she wasn't about to forget about her sister who needed someone to be there for her. A person who would save her from the darkness within her loneliness. ""You can have any opinion you want about her, but she's my sister and we've known each other since we were children. You will not change my view over my own sister so do not even try. I know her better than anyone and your view of her is completely off. She grew stronger on her own without anyone's help and she finds she would get weaker if she [/INST] accepted anyone's help. That's why she feels she has to do everything herself. Because she felt she was too weak to defeat her mother's killer. So she now has to get stronger so that she can confront them again. Try as you must, Nathan but you will never understand Reala or my Aunt Ranathia."" She paused for a moment as her eyes shifted into a more definite expressive position, ""I won't allow you to badmouth them. Remember that, Nathan.""

""What's that?"" Meira questioned when Nathan showed her a flyer of some tournament that was going to enlist people from the schools to enter. She wasn't entirely sure why it was being held, but if it included the word ""dark"" it meant there were no rules other than the occassional ring out. Meaning people would fight until the death if necessary and the opponent could kill their target without consequence. </s>"
109,"<s>[INST] Meira sighed as she noticed Nathan had picked up on the fact that she had deceived him about knowing about her sister. It wasn't like she did intentionally. She had her reasons for lying like that and one of them was she doesn't like talking about her sister. It always ended up in a two sided argument where she would defend her sister no matter what. ""Sorry, I lied about Reala. Just don't like talking about my sister is all. Anyway, I just wish Reala would find some way to be happy. Ever since we were children, she has never smiled or laughed once. She carries around that doom and gloom look everyday. It's like she's empty and very lonely, but it's too dark for her to navigate herself out of her own loneliness. I just wish there were something I could do for. For once, I would like to see her happy. I would like to see her smile or just laugh at [/INST] a funny joke. I'm tired of seeing those sad eyes she drags around for baggage. But she refuses to listen to anyone when it comes to herself. She go as far as talking really nasty so people will dislike or hate her so she doesn't have to worry about them getting in her way again. Why does she have to continue to punish herself like that?""
""Don't underestimate that man, Nathan. I sensed a very dangerous power from him. Exercise extreme caution when fighting him."" Meira warned as she could judge by his character he did not play by the rules nor did he play nice for that matter. Knowing how strong that person was really bothered Meira. Even if he didn't try to slay Reala, still it disturbed her that he made it clear she was his target. She didn't know why he would target her and anytime she tried to recall the confrontation her mind just drew a blank. </s>"
110,"<s>[INST] Class? Meira questioned as she realized the train hadn't arrived yet. Also she saw that Reala was nowhere to be seen. She wasn't sure what Nathan was talking about being late to class? How could they be late if they haven't even arrived at the school yet. ""Nathan, our train isn't even here. I don't know what you are talking about, but this is not a school building. They just use to keep track of how many people enlist into going to school in Windgrace."" Meira sighed as she laughed softly at Nathan's blunder. She thought it was funny that Nathan automatically assumed they were at school. It was apparent to her that he had never been to a school in his entire life [/INST] and the fact he was educated was a little hard to believe.
""Over this way."" Meira said as she grabbed Nathan's hand and dragged him off to the train station which was downstairs underneath the main builiding. The station was crowded with not only students, but other people from Windgrace who were using them to travel to their destination. A row of benches were in front of them with columns off to the side and a few of the walls had vending machines and a very large bin which was for trash stood reside them. Meira let go of Nathan's hand as she walked over and took a seat awaiting for the train to arrive. ""Now we just wait for the train to our school to arrive."" </s>"
111,"<s>[INST] Clueless as ever is he? A familiar voice said as Meira turned around and noticed it was Reala. Meira jumped up in excitement to see her sister had gotten over what was bothering her earlier. Even though she had gotten over it, she still looked so empty and her eyes continued to show the same sadness they always showed. Meira wanted to find some way to make her sister smile, but all her attempts she had tried in the past ended in failure.
""Did you come back to apologize for how you acted earlier, Reala?"" Meira asked where Reala closed her eyes nodding at her. Reala had come back to apologize for her actions toward her sister, but she despised Nathan which made flames ignite underneath her skin though she did her best to control her by remaining composed.
She grabbed Meira where she gave off a small smirk with a nod where she answered Meira's question, ""You, yes."" She paused [/INST] as she gave a cold icy gaze at Nathan where she continued, ""Him, no."" But that was all she said. Meira anticipated she might try to insult Nathan after saying she wasn't going to apologize, but she was wrong. Reala just phrased those two words boldly before she went silent.
""I agree, Nathan doesn't know much about school or how the school systems work around her, but he's not that bad of a person. He's very kind even though he's pretty naive about how this world works."" Meira said only to have Reala interrupted her sighing deeply, ""Yeah Meira, but you have no room to talk either. You are pretty lost on how the world works too."" Despite her hostility toward Nathan and saying a lot of nasty comments about him she still had the dignity inside her to actually defend him. Meira found it strange though she knew it is just like Reala to point out the oversight in people's insults. </s>"
112,"<s>[INST] 'So she knows what this Sentinel thing is?' Nathan thought. 'I guess I shouldn't be too surprised. Although...if she knows, then who else does?' He wondered as he glanced at Meira. Once more deciding not to say anything to Reala to avoid provoking her. 'So she plans to enter the tournament too? That could be problematic if I have to fight her. While I'm very experienced at taking out people like her, there is still that seal on me. Sure my pow [/INST] ers are all back, but for all I know, she could use it on me in the fight. Hell, if what I've heard is right, that would be a perfectly okay thing to do. This isn't looking good' scratching the back of his head in frustration 'I'm going to need to find a way to block her attempts at triggering it, otherwise I might not stand a chance. Or maybe I'll get lucky, and her pride will keep her from using it. Heh, what am I saying? I never get lucky.' </s>"
113,"<s>[INST] Judging by how you are looking at me you think I'm going to pull a dirty trick when we meet in battle and you are dead wrong. I do not use dirty tricks to subdue my foes unless they are malicious. You do not fit that category. You know absolutely nothing about me and yet your body language is already telling me that you think I'm going to cheat. Think what you want if you want to think like a paranoid fool. Doesn't bother me one way or another. Reala said as she turned her attention away from Nathan with no intention of adding anything else to what she had originally said. After she had said that to Nathan a train pulled up where Reala grabbed her bag then began wa [/INST] lking then said with her back turned toward Meira, ""Do you plan on traveling with that bumbling idiot? I wanted to sit next to you on the train, but I'll sit behind you if that nuisance is going to sit across from you.""
Meira looked at Reala and nodded as she followed her onto the train when it stopped and opened its doors. Both walked onto the train then took their seats in the middle of the car placing their bags up above in a storage place above their heads. The train became crowded quickly, but Reala turned her head to notice a short haired girl and another one with the same hairstyle as Meira along with some man who gave her a vibe that she should be cautious. </s>"
114,"<s>[INST] Meira and Reala talked to each other while Nathan sat over by himself until the train finally arrived at its destination. The conductor yelled at the kids it was time for them to get off and head for the school building. It was still a bit early in the morning so the students could hang out with each other until the first bell rang which warned them that they had five minutes before class started. Meira and Reala both walked off together passing by Nathan as they exited the train. They saw that their school was a very large four story building that stretched pretty far in both directions. There were [/INST] four glass doors with lots of windows at the entrance and railings along the sidewalk as they walked up the steps toward the top part of the walkway.
""Oh hello, Alice."" Meira said as she saw Alice had walked by her and Reala both. Reala was busy looking at her phone and Meira was thinking about Ranathia and how much fun she had to be having exploring ruins while she was stuck at school which really sucked for her. ""Why don't you come sit with us. My sister won't bite so don't worry."" She reminded Alice as she waited for her to come take a seat by the two on the steps leading up toward the entrance. </s>"
115,"<s>[INST] The ride on the train was mostly a quiet one, though it soon changed for Alice as she and the rest of the class saw that Princess Meira was in the same class as them. Murmur started to spread and even more so when said princess invited Alice, of all people, to sit near her. Alice fidgeted as she felt the eyes looking at her and looked unsure. She couldn't just ignore the princess' request, could she? She was still trying to make a decision when another one pulled her by her arm towards the two princ [/INST] esses.
""A-Anne!"" Alice yelped toward the smiling girl that's pulling her.
""It would be an honor for her, Your Highness...es,"" the one called Anne said as she pushed a bewildered Alice forward to the seat. ""She's a bit shy, but please take a good care of her.""
The murmur died down for a bit before whispering replaced them, certain people could make out what was being said, which were mostly 'damn, should've thought of that.' The princesses could definitely feel that the eyes were all on them however. </s>"

Meanwhile, her friend beamed at the invitation and nudged Alice with her elbow. ""Oh! Right, um, Princess, th- let me introduce you Anne..nis Rosengard."" She said before Annenis followed up. ""I am honored, Your Higness. Annenis of the Rosengard fami [/INST] ly at your service.""
They both then took a seat when the remaining students also scatter and took their seat, most were grumbling but a few had gathered the courage to approach the princess, but were unable to as the bell rung and a teacher went in.
Alice saw Nathan sitting on the back and gave him an apologetic gesture for the earlier problem with the overseeing teacher. </s>"
117,"<s>[INST] Reala was about to say something when she noticed the boys stopped when they were confronted by what looked to be another pink haired girl, but since her back was turned toward her, neither Reala or Meira could tell who she was. Meira knew that she couldn't be the girl from earlier. That girl wasn't as tall and her hair was styled a bit differently with it in one giant ponytail that was tied off toward her right side. The girl looked at the boys as she moved into a normal stance confronting them with a smile on her face, ""Would you guys mind giving me a hand?""
Several of them drooled at the thought of helping a beautiful girl while a few others were in shock, because of her appearance. They couldn't believe what they just saw. They also couldn't explain how this girl reminded them so much of Meira who was sitting with her sister Reala. The same girl that hung out with their hated enemy Nathan, because they wanted to be closer to that girl. Not some lame old peasant kid that knew nothing about the world around him. ""Sure, what do you want us to help you with, babe?"" One of the boys grinned having dirty thoughts in his mind about what he could do that girl.
""I need someone to warm up on. You guys look good enough to spar with. So how about it?"" The pink haired girl smiled as she smiled toward the boys though underneath her smile was a wicked grin that she was about to mop the floor with these punks.
""Warm up? We'd beat you to a pulp, little girl!"" The boys laughed as they surrounded the girl. Each one of them had their own idea of what they could do with this girl, but she just shook her head. ""Now be a good girl and behave. W [/INST] e aren't going to hurt you."" One of them said as they tried to grab the girl's arm, but she dropped and into a powerful sweep which took his legs out right from underneath him and when another one tried to grab her from behind her fist flew in an upward position slightly over her shoulder as it made contact with his face then a whirlwind kick to kick him away.
""Why you bitch!"" One of them yelled as they charged at the girl where she grinned then charged energy into her fist which was in the color of a very azure blue. The energy accumulated as it hissed and howled as she blasted wind around her due to her aura. Students had to cover their eyes, because of the brightness of the energy when she was absorbing it into her body. A few more boys tried to charge, but when she was fully ready to release the blast, she brought her fist forward in a powerful right hook releasing a massive discharge of energy in the form of a convergent blast which formed a blue dragon that was sent spiraling at her target. As that blast was prepared she turned in a one eighty and brought forth her left hand as hard as she could in a powerful right hook which released a similar blast. Both were convergent blasts in the shape of a serpent like dragon with their mouths wide open as they closed in on her targets. ""Chroma Blast Caliber!""
Meira and Reala looked in shock as the boys were blasted by the energy writhing in pain as it burned them badly. They were then sent backwards landing hard on the ground when the smoke all cleared. The girl had the same grin on her face as when she released it and Meira and Reala were shocked when they saw the girl's face. </s>"
118,"<s>[INST] The name is Taru Zairaveisha. That was fun, can we do it again some time? Taru said as she came into full appearance. The girl was wearing a short red dress with two thin shoulder straps that held on her body. You could see the straps of her bra that the straps laid over neath and her short dress came down to her upper thighs. She wore a pair red and black sandals with no socks. It was apparent Taru enjoyed their little skirmish since she had her eyes closed laughing in joy.
""Oh sorry, Danny. Hello to you too. My mind was taken in by the sudden appearance of that girl who looks like Meira and yes Meira is my sister. We are twin sisters, in fact."" Reala apologized as she turned her attention away from the pink haired girl who had just mopped the floor with a group of boys. That [/INST] kind of energy she used wasn't one that Reala knew about. That attack also looked a lot like the Elan Blast Caliber except she used her fists and instead of palms. She also used a one eighty twist to launch the second one.
""That girl looks like..."" Meira paused as she found herself unable to finish that statement. She was in shock when she saw a girl who looked exactly like her. Her appearance down to her eyes, nose, chin and face resembled Meira perfectly. What was going on? She thought in her mind as she couldn't find any explanation of what just happened in her mind. That girl sounded like she was having fun when she was fighting those boys? But where did she come from and who exactly is she? She said her name was Taru Zeiraveisha. Don't exactly recognize that name at all. </s>"
119,"<s>[INST] Taru saw a group of people staring at her that were seated near the entrance of the building, she walked over while teachers behind her were talking about something. Most likely what just happened after Taru took out several boys who were about to jump Nathan. She walked over toward the people having a seat while her sister was standing with a man right behind her who all watched what had just happened a moment ago. Taru knelt down onto one knee as she spoke toward the group, ""Oh hello, Nathan."" She paused as she looked at Nathan. She then directed her attention toward Meira and Reala, ""How are you doing Meira and Reala?"" Meira and Reala both looked at this totally confused. How did this girl know thei [/INST] r names and also know Nathan's name? What exactly was going on? The other students were still stunned by the sudden appearance of the pink haired maiden as they could only stare onward unable to say a single word as the students suddenly went very quiet.
Meira nerves jumped in her body when she heard the girl call her name. Not only did she look just like her, but now she knew her name? Who was this mysterious girl and why was she there in the first place? Meira was completely left speechless like the rest of the students and it didn't look like Reala could get off a word either. She was about to answer Danny, but the shock from what just happened now made it difficult for either of the girls to speak. </s>"
120,"<s>[INST] Taru. A voice said coldly as it revealed itself to be the same man that was standing there earlier, but when he removed his veil he looked like a very young man with long silver blueish hair. The man was wearing the same school uniform the other students were wearing except he wore a very large black duster over top of it.
Taru eyes dazzled when she saw how handsome this person she knew looked like when he was younger. She couldn't contain her thoughts of how much of a hunk she thought he looked like. All the other girls were falling over their selves too over the good looks of this man. They had never met such a mysterious handsome young man in their school before. ""Wow Sentius, you are a looker when you were younger. I can't believe that you are the same Sentius I knew when you used your other body.""
Sentius despite all the girls going wild over him ignored them all. He didn't really look like the social kind since he didn't even answer Taru's compliment about him. He didn't have time to waste with girls going wild over him. He had unfinished business he had to attend to and first he could do it by testing the balance in the area. Enrolling in the school was a perfect opportunity for him to gauge the area and the damage it had taken from one month ago. He heard a fool destroyed a vital pillar and it damaged the Chrono Sphere barrier. Like usual, he didn't say a word remaining very quiet.
""Oh sorry, Sentius."" Taru said apologetically as [/INST] she rose to her feet and walked away from Meira and the others. It was obvious that Sentius didn't want her to intermingle with the others, but she wasn't entirely sure why.
Reala couldn't contain her self-interest for this man she just saw. She had never in her entire life seen someone look so handsome and so self-reserved that he immediately piqued her interest without a second thought. ""Excuse me, sir? Sentius you said your name was?"" She said as she thought to herself where did I hear that name before? She continued to think about it until it came to her. The former leader of N.E.M.E.S.I.S. and an enemy or that is what she thought he was. But he didn't look as dangerous as he did back then. There was something very different about him now. Not just by how he looked, but she knew he was older than this. Did he change bodies by chance? If that's the case, he would be able to use his full power, but I'm sure he lost all his experience and has to regain it through combat. That is the one bad thing about changing bodies.
""His name is Nathan."" Meira said toward Danny since Reala looked to be charmed by the sudden appearance of the new mysterious looking high school student who mesmerized all the other girls too. ""Forgive Reala, she's in a trance over the beauty of that handsome young man. I can't contain myself from being allured by him either."" She gawked as she was getting over her head also swept in by the appearance of the young fellow. </s>"
121,"<s>[INST] Nathan just groaned ""this is not what I need"" he mumbled to himself. 'As much as I'd like to just move and avoid any trouble, I know better then that. It's starting to look like school isn't to different from the wild. And if there's one thing I learned about the wild; it's that you never show weakness in front of anyone potentially hostile. Shaking his head, he addressed the girl ""no. No I will not move. I was here before you, and I've already gotten comfortable. You can say whatever you want, but I really doubt that you'll get a rise out of me. [/INST] However know that if you try to escalate this into a physical confrontation, I will defend myself. I am in a really bad mood today, so I think it's in everyone's best interest if you just drop this.""
Danny on the other hand just brushed off her insult without any problem ""you know, you're being awfully mean. People don't like to be around mean people like that. If you keep treating others like that, then you'll end up alone and bitter. Just like old miss Spinster, back in my home village. She didn't have anyone, and I always felt so sorry for her."" </s>"
122,"<s>[INST] Alice was bewildered over what's happening in her way to class. At first it was only something as mild as some people planning to bully another person, that's as normal happening in a place where the nobles were trying to enforce their superiority. Then things got weirder from there as another person showed up and proceeded to beat the snot out of the snobs. However the person seemed to be another sister of the Princess. To top everything off, a handsome guy was involved and all the [/INST] girls seemed to lose all the ability to think and gone over to be bitches in heat. Even Annenis was confused that the majority of the girls all went batshit insane before they both find a quiet corner to seat themselves in.
""Ookkkay, that's a bit over the top for a random dreamy pretty guy,"" Annenis said as she heard one of the girls not only tried to push Nathan away but also resorted to insults.
""At least the teacher's here already,"" Alice groaned, distaste was obvious in her voice. </s>"
123,"<s>[INST] Mr Squall walked in rather calmly with a coffee cup firmly in his hand. He looked towards Nathan, and quickly stopped he shouldn't even be in this class, and simply ignored him. He turned towards Meira, ""In [/INST] order to rule, you must learn to be ruled. Leadership requires displicine, which you clearly lack. Now, I will give you the choice of you learning this on your own, or if I need to drill it into your head."" </s>"
124,"<s>[INST] Meira's statement hit the rest of the class like a truck. Some of the students were gobsmacked at the sheer ridiculousness of what Meira was attempting but most were simply unable to hold their amusement and the class was filled with various state of laughter. Even Alice, who normally woul [/INST] d frown at an attempt of bribery, quietly laughed at Meira and her words. There were also a few whispers that those in the student seats could probably hear from their place, mostly speculations that Meira's blatant bribery attempt was her attempt to deliberately fail the class altogether. </s>"
125,"<s>[INST] Just as the person was about to speak, he saw an angel like blonde hair man appear out of a portal created. This man stood right next to Ranathia as the portal closed swallowed into the void it came out of. He looked over toward this person and looked at him with irritation in his eyes, ""I don't ever remember inviting you. Why don't you make like that portal you came out of and disappear.""
""Mithos, why are you here?"" Ranathia questioned caught by [/INST] surprise by Mithos sudden emergence. She never sent for help and how did he know where she was anyway? He couldn't have just sensed her since she lost everyone's energy readings after she entered the ruins. Though she did sense a very strong presence emerge then suddenly disappear after he got there. Perhaps it had to do something with who he represents? She thought to herself as she kept one hand firm on her blade as she let it caress the surface. </s>"
126,"<s>[INST] The individual still hidden by the darkness was about to approach Mithos when a hand stopped him. Another individual a bit taller had used his hand in a gesture in front of his body to stop him from getting any further. The man then peered at the two from the dark depths they were veiled in. ""It's okay, Luther. Even though this person came unannounced I could use his duress situation to my advantage."" He paused as he snapped his fingers where an individual brought a symbolic figurine that shined forward and put it in his hand. ""How about a proposition for you?"" He took a brief pause as he took one step closer to Mithos, but keeping his distance so he could not see his face. ""I will give you this Rune of Power to restore your pillar that was taken from another dimension in exchange for The Key. The girl comes with me and all your problems vanish like they never happened. Are we at an agreement?
""Wait a minute!"" Ranathia interrupted when she realized he just said Rune of Power. She didn't know whether it was a trick or not. The fact that this person kept himself hidden meant he was likely to deceive people and didn't want to the person he deceived to see his face. ""Are you saying that if I go with you that all Mithos probl [/INST] ems will go away? Do you really have that kind of power? And the Rune of Power was destroyed. I saw it with my own two eyes."" She reminded him as she stepped forward keeping her hand firm and stead on her sword just in case he might try to attack them while they were distracted.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sentius looked at what the teacher was putting down though he seemed to show no actual interest in what he was writing. He thought to himself as he had to force himself to listen to all that rubbish. This is amateur criteria. It has nothing to do with me and someone of my caliber doesn't need to pay attention to such feeble knowledge.
""What do those symbols mean?"" Meira questioned as she had no idea what he was talking about. This kind of magic she was not at all informed about and when she took a look over at Sentius his eyes showed a sign of disinterest. While she pulled her attention back onto the teacher she thought to herself quietly. Of course he doesn't care. Why would someone of his level care about magic that is far inferior to his own? But why does he insist on forcing himself to pay attention like that? It's a bit disturbing if you ask me. </s>"
127,"<s>[INST] Sheer disappointment overshadowed the man's face as he continued to keep his distance so neither Mithos or Ranathia could see him. The man was hoping to come to agreement with Mithos, but now that they were at a disagreement meant he would have to try a whole another approach. He turned his attention away from Mithos and thought maybe he could persuade Ranathia to surrender herself into his custody. He took a step forward and made a few gestures toward Ranathia while talking in an attempt to persuade her to make a better decision than Mithos did. ""Ranathia."" He paused for a moment as he tried to get her attention where he got a simple yes response from her lips. ""Surely you understand if you agree to my terms that Mithos will no longer be plagued with the problems that haunt him from a month ago. In fact, I will also help you to figure out the mysteries about who you are that you want to know. I'm sure you want to know why you're The Key and the reason you possess such a special object known as the Rune of Knowledge, correct?"" He took a brief pause as he gave her a chance to answer before he would see if Mithos would interrupt if she agreed bef [/INST] ore he continued with what he was going to say.
""If I agree to go with you as you requested, do I have your word that you will fix Mithos problems and restore the broken pillar from the loss of the Rune of Power? I know that rune in your hand is the Rune of Power, but I don't know where you got it. Though if it will help Mithos and clear him of all doubt and suspicion I may be inclined to your agreement. I am curious though, why do you need me that badly? You spoke The Key then you talked about having Mithos hand ""the girl"" meaning me over to you. What do you look to gain from having me in your captivity?"" Ranathia said as she nodded at the man agreeing to his terms though before she came to her final decision she wanted to at least hear what he knew. She was sure that even Mithos probably wanted to know what was going on though she was a little worried that Mithos might try to intervene due to this person he spoke of who talked to him a moment ago. Strangely enough to Ranathia he didn't recognize that it was perhaps the spirit he was align with. if that was the case then perhaps going against the spirits might not provide decent odds for them. </s>"

129,"<s>[INST] Mr Squall turned to the board, ignoring most of the questions for the time being. ""These five symbols represent the five different types of ancient glitch magic. The arrow pointing towards the line represents overload magic. The upward arrow with the two smaller lines represents scale magic. These are known as chaotic glitch magics since they are based on trends, and then outcomes are not always predictable and they can be used for many different functions. The Three Xs with a line through represents spy magic, and the two circles with a line through represents Trojan magic. These two types of magic are forms of evasive glitch, still they abuse faults in magical defenses or magical systems. This final type of glitch magic is special, for it is both a type and sub-type. This symbol, "" he said pointing at each in turn, before pointing to the final, bottom one, ""represents total chaotic magic. Magic where the [/INST] outcome is unpredictable. This type has no sub-types because in order to be total chaotic, there can be no trends nor intended functions.""
He then paused, ""I see many of you rolling your eyes, since most if not all you have not use this magic nor plan to. However magic is more than a tool to be used. It is a tool to be understood. Two of these magics, Trojan and Total Chaotic, are banned nearly universally by law, however these are types of magics you can not run from, nor overpower. These types of magic are more so magic theory, and the only way to overcome them is to out-think them. Not only do I like to start with these to see if we have any particular bright stars, but to demonstrate a point, not only do you have to know your magic, or not need to know any about magic if you can not use it, but knowing magics you can not even use can be very helpful for a variety of reasons, one key reason is defense."" </s>"

The man grinned as he just sat back and watched the events unfold. His work had been done which was to turn this foolish woman against the one she was working for.
Just as Ranathia was about to hit the wall a light appeared out of nowhere and a being with golden wings which was a girl with long blonde hair appeared out of nowhere and caught Ranathia before she hit the wall. Ranathia looked back and noticed it was someone she knew all too well. She smiled as the being cradled her in her arms. ""Evangelina..."" She said to the girl as her body was engulfed in a powerful golden light that would blind normal mortals eyes. ""I'm so happy to see you're still around. I you perished that very long time ago."" Ranathia said as tears rolled down her eyes of the happiness to see that Evangelina had not been destroyed in their fight with Sentius a long time ago. She really did think that she had been absorbed by Sentius most powerful technique, but it seems that was not the case. ""It's all right, [/INST] Ranathia. I am here now to support you. I see that Xaliana has been in contact with that person over there."" She paused as she pointed her finger at the blonde haired man where Ranathia just gave her a nod.
""This gets even more interesting."" The man who was betrayed by Bethel said as he knew that this was an opportunity to study the depths of her own power. He had heard from his sources that her Spirit had been devoured by Sentius Primordial Lightning Awakening technique, but to see her Spirit still around showed him that Ranathia was more powerful than he once imagined.
""Quite a bold action."" A girl's voice said as another girl with golden like wings appeared out of nowhere except this one had blue hair and was dressed in a skimpy looking dress that showed a lot of skin on the sides. ""Perhaps you are worthy of my time, Mithos.""
""Xaliana?"" Ranathia questioned since she knew judging by the girl's looks that it had to be Xaliana. Xaliana was the only blue haired girl who would dress so provocatively. Though her wardrobe was much better than the metal bikini armor that Sigma always wore adorning it on her body. </s>"

Alkmaar held out his hand shaking his head as a wide grin filled his face. ""Patience Luther, there is no need to rush anything. Besides, the girl did reveal some interesting knowledge which could prove useful to me later on. I'll let her have her prize for at least being resourceful."" He answered as he stood forward to reveal himself to both Mithos and Ranathia. He was a very well built and tall man who towered over the two. He also wore red clothing where his hood and mask covered most of his face. Neither of the two could tell at all what he looked li [/INST] ke, but judging by the fancy clothing he adorned on his body he had to be quite powerful.
Alkmaar took another step forward while he continued to grin at the two, ""Impressive display, boy. Rather impressive how you handled that woman."" He paused as he gave the two a chance to answer him before he was going to continue with what he was about to say. The two were surrounded on all sides since his men were able to move into formation without detection.
""What do you plan to do to us, Alkmaar? I know you're no pushover like that woman he just fought."" Ranathia asked as she was about to grab the giant sword she carried on her back. The man shook his head and in a dismissive hand gesture got her to return her hands to her side. It didn't look like he wanted to fight either of the two. Ranathia knew this wasn't good since she didn't think either of them could match Alkmaar's power. </s>"

The large fist came out of nowhere and looked like an extension of the shadow she just saw on the ground. The fist was connected to an arm and they both were black in color. She could not believe that this man just easily to them both out. She cringed as she hit the wall hard making a imprint of herself on the wall before she slid to the ground. ""Ugh, he's just too powerful. That attack just blindsided me and there was nothing I could do abou [/INST] t it."" Ranathia said as she slowly rose to her feet dusting herself off as Alkmaar just stood there. She knew Alkmaar used a really powerful form of magic that she knew was forbidden.
Alkmaar grinned as he watched Ranathia rise to her feet after displaying to her some of his power. ""As you can see, neither of you stand a chance against me. So, what will it be, boy? Surrender the girl and join me or choose for this to be your grave. You better choose wisely, because I am not going to give you much time to decide.

He wasn't displeased at all, he seemed to be amused by what Mithos just did. He then illuminated his body with a bright light before he disappeared into nothingness. Luther seemed to be very displeased and when he tried to yell at his men he was stifled by Alkmaar who held out his hand and shook his head. He reminded Luther that there would be another opportunity. There was no need to rush it.
When they got into the clear back toward the entrance of the ruins where the portal that appeared disappeared, Ranathia took a seat on one of the br [/INST] oken slabs that laid tilted on the ground as she tried to recuperate herself after being hit by Alkmaar's attack. ""It looks like I was tricked into coming here where Alkmaar laid a trap to capture me. I didn't even see it coming either. I'm such a fool..."" Ranathia said discouraged as she looked at the ground in disappointment about being deceived. The ruins were authentic, but they were used to lure her into a trap and she allowed herself to follow the bait. ""HOW COULD HAVE I BEEN SO CARELESS!?""

It traveled around the rainbow like space like area for awhile until it exited. ""I have retracted time to exactly five hours prior to the events of today.""

Only that one event had been changed where it never happened while Mithos and Ranathia were still up in the ship.

The reading was pretty weak so it had to be a regular mortal with no special abilities to offer. ""I sensed her presence on the Davustra while I was in slumber. Though why did she appear on the Davustra? And what was that Angelian trying to do? I know he was trying to alter the past, but it seems he caused a disturbance between their meeting with that Professor."" He said as he walked over and took a seat on some of the old crates that lay on the floor inside one of the old warehouses. It was obvious it was an industrialized area since there several looking factory buildings with smoke stacks that peered into the sky. ""Perhaps I should find this person. I might be able to find Xei and find exactly what is going on in our present time? If I have been awakened by her then it means something serious is about to go down."" He said as he tried to pick up the fix on the Angelian's location then found as he enveloped himse [/INST] lf in light and disappeared in a flash. An old man with glasses came out of hiding confused by what he had just saw. He had been waiting for someone to show, but they never came. He decided to leave exiting the warehouse realizing that they were never going to show.
Ranathia was lying in the bed stripped down to her undergarments and put in bed covered with blankets as a towel was put over her head. It seemed she had a fever and the hand maidens of the house were trying their best to comfort while they could. They didn't know exactly why her body was covered in strange markings that they did not understand or why it glowed like a Roman candle. Ranathia toss and turned in bed looking unwell as she muttered in her sleep a very strange chant which no one understood. From her look on her face and her cringing face it looked like she was having a nightmare. When Mithos returned one of the housemaids confronted Mithos informing him about Ranathia's current situation. ""We don't understand at all what happened to her. Her condition has not changed and it looks like she is very sick, Mithos. Do you have any idea what could have happened to Lady Ranathia?"" She said as you could see Ranathia was really pale and her head was so hot that it felt like there was an inferno raging inside her body. </s>"
143,"<s>[INST] She looked over toward one of the other hand maidens and told them to fetch a doctor immediately. The one she looked at nodded and immediately took off full stride out the door of the manor in search of a doctor. The other one do what she could to comfort her. She was about to change the towel on her forehead when a voice startled her out of nowhere and she turned to see a silver haired man dressed in black clothes appear right behind her.
""It seems the poison of her own power is having a negative effect on her body. Her body is not used to what she is experiencing so it is doing its best to guard against it."" He apused momentarily as he walked over toward her other side examining her body including the strange marks on her body that glowed. ""It is too early for her power to awaken and if we do not do something about it, her condition could become fatal."" The man said as he walked over to examine her situation. It was the same man Mithos and Ranathia [/INST] saw on the ship and the very same figure he saw at the abandoned warehouses. Though when you got a closer glimpse he resembled the man who appeared out of nowhere that Mithos ran into except this man was all alone and not accompanied by any female figures.
""Who are you?"" The housemaids said as they went on the defensive from the sudden emergence of an intruding figure that did not enter the manor like normal people would. They thought he might be some kind of thief, but the man shook his head informing them that he had no interest in what they call money.
One of the hand maidens was about to touch Ranathia's body where the marks appeared, but the man grabbed her hand and shook his head. He informed her that touching the marks would poison her and since she wasn't as strong as Ranathia it would prove fatal to her. ""Those are runes on her body that no normal mortal can touch. If you touched one the effect might prove catastrophic for you or even fatal."" </s>"
144,"<s>[INST] I know how to cure her though I doubt you would want to know how. The way I am talking about is way too cruel for her and would cause her tremendous pain and suffering. The man said as he made his way toward the exit. He knew that she would have to learn the same technique that Sentius and him had learned. Though since her body was infected with the energy and with it poisoning her meant that her vital organs were probably becoming weaker. If he nothing was done in her current state she could die from her organs decomposing after a certain stage.
One of the housemaids stood in the path of the man and begged him to help their Lady Ranathia. She owed a great bit of gratitude to her since if [/INST] it weren't for her she would still be a poor young woman on the street scrounging for food in a dangerous environment. ""Please, sir! We beg of you! Save Lady Ranathia. We owe her so much and if we could help persuade you to at least try to save her life would be a payment toward the debt we already owe her.""
""You don't understand."" The man said as he moved her out of his way. He then turned around with a very serious fierce look on his face. The straight face ferocious look was an indication he was not kidding about anything he said. ""The way to save her could kill her as well. She would suffer for nothing? Do you honestly think I would want to put her through that! Now get out of my way."" </s>"
145,"<s>[INST] I came here to see if she was doing well, but I saw she wasn't. He paused for a moment as he turned away from the door and closed it instead of leaving like he was about to. ""Do not get the wrong idea. My care for her is strong, but I wouldn't ever want to put her through suffering for no reason. It would make me no different than someone who was torturing her."" He paused once again as you could sense the sincerity inside his serious voice. It was obvious that this man cared deeply for her. Enough to not want to put her through torture even if she was near death. Everyone's eyes gazed upon him as they stared in suspicion that he did not care about her at all even though his words said otherwise.
""Fine."" He said raising his voice in frustration. He [/INST] walked over toward her beside then turned toward Mithos and the housemaids. ""I will perform a very dangerous Ancient Magic on her. Whether she learns it is up to her, but it will put her through enormous pain and suffering. Is that what you really want for her, Mithos? I know you are foolishly allowing your mortal thoughts to tell you she doesn't care about you, but she very much does. She saved you from being crushed by the rocks inside the ruin. If you really care about, would you subject her to such torment?""
""You all look at me like I'm some sort of villain anyway."" He added as he gazed at her body taking a close look at the runes that glowed and her condition which was starting to slowly get worse since she started to show symptoms of coughing. </s>"
146,"<s>[INST] The man ignored the part where Mithos complained about him saying a few words that looked condescending to him. Regardless of how he felt, he didn't really care one way or another. They were just words and those affected by mere words he found were weak-minded. He woke Ranathia up who was very weak and had to be carried by the two hand maidens toward the outside where he was going to perform his technique. She didn't look to be herself and her eyes looked very dead when as they just gazed where she did not say a word.
""Ranathia, I need you to listen to me very closely. Nod yes if you understand what I'm saying."" She nodded slowly with her head yes as he took his duster off and put it around her so no one could see her undergarments she was wearing. He then closed his eyes and calmed his power then opened them as it looked like a bolt of lightning struck him from above and is energy just ignited almost knocking everyone off their feet causing several people to be blinded by the blast of the aura he let loose. He slowly calmed it to a more gentle phase then looked at Ranathia and told her to do the samething.
Ranathia took up a position mimicking exactly what he said to do, but stopped when she felt a sharp pain in her body. It felt like her body was about to explode, but he told her to contin [/INST] ue or else it would just get worse. She needed to expel that energy that was poisoning her body outward so that it wasn't bottled up in her body. If she didn't, he informed everyone that her organs would slowly decompose which was not a good sign. Ranathia tried to attempt what he said, but she was too scared to do it. She knew the Ancient Magic he taught her known as the Lightning Rod Effect was extremely dangerous and one wrong move and she could blow up the entire area and not mean to. She was too frightened to attempt it, but her condition got worse where she coughed and this time spit up blood which fell to the ground. ""I Can't do it, I'm too scared. If I fail I'll kill myself and everyone around me. There is no way I can bring myself to do that!"" She stubbornly protested as he attempted to convince her in any way possible that it was the only way she was going to get better.
He looked over toward Mithos closing his eyes then sighed as he started to speak, ""It's up to you, Mithos. If you really do not care about her life then you can just do nothing and let her die. But if you have even an ounce of dignity left you'll try to find some way to get her over her fear. If she continues like this, she will surely die within hours. There is not much time, she has to stay focused and keep calm."" </s>"
147,"<s>[INST] Listen Ranathia; you have to do this. If you do not, then you will surly die. And if you die, then what will happen to your niece? The girl is already lazy enough when it comes to her duties, what do you think will happen if her only remaining family dies? Ranathia heard from Mithos which made her ponder what he just said. She said to herself in her mind. Does he really care about me? I have a strange feeling inside my body, but I cannot explain it. Right when she was about to continue thinking to herself a voice resounded to her in her head. The voice was full of warmth which caused the ice cold doubt to finally leave her body and prevent her from being paralyzed by the fear of the own recklessness of the magic. Ranathia allowed the energy to flow like a lightning bolt as she did her best to endure the pain. You could see her cringing face which writhed in severe pain as the dangerous poison inside her body was being expended into the ground.
As the energy got less tense she felt the pain going away. All was going well until a shiny object appeared from her expending that energy out of the ground with stra [/INST] nge markings on it. The object that appeared was a shiny spherical orb which looked like it was cracking until it broke where shards of light shot off in various directions. No one really knew what happened, but the orb shattering caused Ranathia to collapse. Her pulse was checked and it was quite normal. Though no one could explain what just happened a moment ago. The man who taught her the magic did not say a word about what happened even though he didn't seem to like it by the unhappy look on his face. The housemaids carried Ranathia off back to her bed.
""If you really care about her."" He said to Mithos in the distance as he disappeared into the shadows which swallowed him into the darkness. ""Then you will help her find herself. It is obvious you care about her. She will not be herself and it is your duty to protect her and make sure that she regains what she just lost. Do not worry about what happened. It was expected to happen. That is all I can say. Please do not leave her side, okay?"" Those were his finally words as no other words could be heard as the man was gone with no trace of him around anymore. </s>"
148,"<s>[INST] While Squall was talking about the principles of magic, fragments of an object that came out of Ranathia had shattered being shot into the sky toward space and soaring to unknown regions. Unfortunately, one of the trajectories was the school in which he was teaching. The students for the most part were paying attention to their teacher while some others were giving him funny faces and a few others mocking him. Sentius just looked on like he didn't care at all in the world. Just as he was about to quell the annoyance of the delinquents behind him Meira sensed something about to fall in their direction where she tu [/INST] rned her head toward the window and said, ""What is that? It's like a shooting star headed this direction. The students were about to jump up and immediately exit the room in fear of a collision, but the object made a huge explosion several meters away from their classroom, but the impact was strong enough to shatter the windows where they covered their eyes to avoid the glass fragments flowing into the air from the magnitude of the blast. One of the students jumped up and questioned toward Squall when the dust cleared, ""Mr. Squall, do you have any idea what just happened?"" He said with concern embracing his eyes. </s>"
149,"<s>[INST] When the dust cleared, both Meira and Reala's hands had a glow to them where a strange rune like figured appeared. The entire class was baffled by the strange glow that their hands were giving off. Meira looked down at her hand and touched the glow and noticed a certain warmth to that glow then she thought she could hear Ranathia's voice nearby? But how was that even possible? Last she knew Ranathia had gone to some ruins and left them all behind. Reala also noticed Ranathia's voice, but she tried to contain her surprise as she didn't want to cause an unnecessary incident during their class.
Alice and Annenis were whispering before Alice turned towards Meira, ""Miss Meira, do you know what just exploded? You're the one that saw it first.""
""I don't really have an answer."" Meira paused as she turned her attention toward Alice and Annenis, but she gave them a widened smile letting them know that it wasn't anything particularly dangerous that had crashed into the ground. Something inside her told her it wasn't though it didn't really give any indication to where the strange object had come from in the first place.
The two turned to look where Sentius was sitting and he was gone. He had disappeared like a shot without anyone noticing that he was gone. Before anyone knew Sentius had already gone outside, but no one knew how he got there so fast. He didn't even get up from his desk and no one saw him leave the room. Right when they were occupied by the crash landing of [/INST] the object Meira noticed a disturbance around where Sentius was sitting. She wondered to herself if he had used his technique that is unique to him to get outside without anyone ever noticing he had left.
Sentius walked over toward the strange object and began examining it. He noticed a familiarity about it though he couldn't quite place his finger onto it until he heard a voice come from. When he heard the voice he was struck with surprise since the voice coming from it was none other than Ranathia. He had met before, but it was a long time ago. Judging by the serious look on his face you could tell that Sentius knew exactly what had just happened after he analyzed the object. He looked at the ground observing the object as he thought to himself. ""This is a part of Ranathia. It's a part of her memory that has been separated from her body, but how did it get separated and did her Memoria Matrix shatter just like glass?"" He paused for a moment as he cupped the object into his hand looking at it more closely. ""I must return this to her. She probably isn't herself at all and that foolish brother of hers hasn't been looking out for her! How could he allow this happen!""
One of the students that noticed that Sentius had just left the room without saying a word or getting permission turned his attention toward the teacher asking him, ""Mr. Squall, that mean looking silver haired guy left the room without even asking? Isn't that against the regulations of this academy?"" </s>"
150,"<s>[INST] Sentius saw that Squall had approached him where he turned his head to face him. He took the fragment he found on the ground from the wreckage and pocketed it. Afterward he turned one of his eyes toward the classroom to make sure Meira and Reala were both safe before he turned that eye back on Squall facing him face to face.
He noticed Squall had become very suspicious of his behavior when he listened to the man confront him with, ""What are you doing here, and what was you doing in my classroom. You clearly was not, nor are a student.""
Sentius closed his eyes and gave off a light sigh where he knew he would have to reveal some of his motives to get this person from becoming suspicious about him. He started off by answering the first part of his question which was addressed to him as what was his purpose in enrolling in the school in the first place. ""I am acting as a vanguard to protect two of your students from a dangerous and very sinister force.""
He paused for a moment as he turned his eyes toward the two girls he was talking about before he continued with what he was about to say. ""Let me warn you that both your students Meira and Reala have both been targeted by a man who runs a terrorist organization by the name of Alkmaar. His motives to me are clear which those two girls are essential toward his Perfect Unification Plan or PUP which I have no intention of participating in. You have two options. You can either trust me and help me safeguard those two girls from this threat since I have two of the other pieces he needs in my possession that I am watching over or you can choose to become my enemy. I have no intention of harming your students and I will adhere to any punishment you deem necessary for interrupting your class."" He concluded as he turned [/INST] his back toward Squall and began to walk back toward the doors that lead him into the classroom, but turned to face Squall one last time to see if he had anything further to say.
Reala noticed Sentius said the name Alkmaar when she was reading the movement of his lips. She thought to herself as she looked over toward Meira then Nathan. After that she turned her eyes toward Danny and last Annenis and then Alice to see what their reactions were toward the situation. Alice and Annenis looked on in confusion which was typical and Danny looked the same way to her, but she noticed Nathan was acting all strange for some reason. Her eyes were filled with suspicion when he started to be on guard for no apparent reason like he was paranoid. To her, he looked like someone was out to get him which made her give off a long sigh in direction. ""Relax you dolt, it was just an unidentifiable object that crashed landed. It's nothing that isn't natural and you act like as if it was a ploy of some kind by some unknown enemy. So naive...""
""Reala, can't you try to be nice and get along with Nathan?"" Meira questioned as she soon let her voice be heard after hearing the insults Reala poked toward Nathan. She didn't understand why her sister was acting like Nathan was some sort of enemy of hers. If it was over what happened earlier she just needed to let that go already. What had happened was already history now and there was no point on mulling over it.
Reala ignored what Meira said as she turned her eyes and peered down at Alice. She then spoke in a much softer and more polite toward Alice asking, ""Is everything okay, Alice? There is no need to be scared since all it was is an unidentifiable object that poses no direct that which crashed into the ground outside our classroom."" </s>"
151,"<s>[INST] Ah, if you're sure... Alice replied to Reala, a bit surprised that the Meira look-a-like spoke to her, especially without the heated tone she seemed to use on everyone else, particularly Nathan. ""It's just... not something that happened often.""
""Yes, even when the seniors got into a fight they usually didn't get past the barrier,"" Annenis added. ""That something impacted the barrier and still have enough force to shatter the windows was unheard of. I do sincerely hope it's not another attack.""
They listened to Meira and Reala's reply, with Alice giving Nathan a sad look and Annenis a pitying hea [/INST] dshake after hearing his comment. The two girls turned their attention to the front when Squall returned and demonstrated his magic. Alice looked towards the board, looking for mentions of Overload magic among the words written on it. Meanwhile, Annenis looked at the exploded pencil and the broken windows before rising her arm.
""Sir, the blast from the object was a lot more powerful than the pencil's. Are there other variables that affect the result of the magic beyond the object's magical threshold? And how would we be sure that we wouldn't burn ourselves out from trying to use Overload magic?"" </s>"
152,"<s>[INST] Squall quickly turned to the student with questions, ""Yes, Overload magic is much more complex than magical threshold, though magical threshold is the core of it. There is also threshold elasticity, threshold growth, and magical stability, the properties of the material in use, and we have not even started to talk about systems in overload magic, which are two or more objects made of different materials which freely shared magic energies between all parts, and equal systems and unequal systems. As for your other question, it is a process of knowing the magical threshold of an object, as well as related variables, and knowing how much magic you have left. Overload magic may seem simple at first, b [/INST] ut requires a good eye for magic, a good control over your magic, and a a good tank of magic. You also must have cost-benefit analyze skills to know when overload magic would be better or another form of magic would be better, but all types of spellcasters can benefit from that skill."" He said, very clearly but also very quickly.
He then decided that he should do something about the fight outside. A grin came across his face. He reached into his pocket, and teleported what he grabbed from there down near where they was fighting. From a distance, it was really hard to make out. But those that could, it was a silver necklace with a decoration at the end which looked like a tree growing into a book. </s>"
153,"<s>[INST] Ranathia looked down then started to turn bright red from the embarrassment of not realizing she had just walked out of her room not properly dressed. She immediately returned to her room and sorted through the clothes. Strangely she went through them all and saw none that she liked. She had one of the hand maidens fetch something from Meira's room. The hand maiden didn't quit understand why she wanted what she was asking for, but returned to her with some fancy looking clothes and with the insignia EP on them. She put on a very long dress that stretched down to her ankles and put on a pair of light blue high heels. She also put a tiara on her head which lettered EP. When she was done getting herself ready she walked out of the room in very fancy clothes that rich officials would wear. ""Why am I in the Standard Dimension and where is this place I am at?"" She paused for a moment as she stepped out of her room before closing the door with her scepter at her side.
""I'm sorry for my lack of manners since I'm v [/INST] ery confused, allow me to introduce myself properly, I am the Erewhon Pavilion chieftain leader Princess Xeiyenreisha Wurzhan'dreis Vandesleiva'Reizure. You may just address me as Xei. I am a proud member of the Vandesleiva'Reizure family and the last descendant of the family. I am on an inter-dimensional mission to prevent your dimension from meeting the same fate as the dimension I was born from known as the Elan Dimension."" She paused for a moment as she walked over and took a seat in one of the chairs. When she did so, she noticed one of the hand maidens mentioned the name Ranathia. She didn't know who exactly that was, but she felt a vibe from Mithos that felt familiar. ""Who is this Ranathia you speak of?"" She questioned toward Mithos as her old memories had finally resurfaced. This person didn't act like Ranathia at all. It was a completely different person from Ranathia. It was obvious that the person in front of them had to be some sort of high ranking noble but they couldn't place the finger on it. </s>"
154,"<s>[INST] Closing her eyes and sighing Xei decides that she will reveal why she keeps her identity secret. She wasn't entirely sure that it would help him understand the situation better, but at least this way he could assess the problematic circumstance she had been thrown into. She gave off a simple ahem before she started to speak to him formally in her usual tone. ""I suppose I should reveal why my existence has been kept secret."" She paused for a moment then recognized by Mithos voice that he had a problem of his own and then remembered he said that she wasn't the 'Ranathia' he knew. She smiled in her mind as her thoughts passed through. Of course I am not the Ranathia you remember. I have no idea who that even is though this person gives me an unsettling vibe I cannot explain. Like when I hear or think about the name something inside me becomes warm. So strange...
Before she was going to reveal her motive toward keeping who she really was secret first she had to test Mithos to make sure that he was trustworthy. She just met this person and didn't know if she could trust him or not. Regardless if he knew this Ranathia that she was supposed to know didn't mean she should just be so willing to trust him so easily. ""Before I go into detail about who exactly I am and the answers you want to why everything seems so confusing I want you to understand that you do not live alone. As you know there are four planes of existence; however, there are other dimensions that exist outside your Standard Dimension. The Lower Dimension is divided into alternate dimensions that you are not aware of. I am not from your dimension. I actually [/INST] hail from what is called the Elan Dimension which is one of the dimensions that you do not know exists. The other alternate dimensions are the Ascadian, your Standard Dimension and lastly the Original Dimension. I have counterparts you have encountered who look a lot like me. We still bear our distinguishing different traits. Meira and Reala are my counterparts who live in the Standard Dimension. I am the Elan Dimension version of a girl named Reala. I have a sister by the name of Lenna who is Meira's dimensional counterpart from the same dimension. You may have met another set of girls who resemble the two named Tarumi and Anayame. They are the counterparts from the Ascadian Dimension.""
She paused for a moment as she asked for a glass of water and to rest her voice for a moment as she continued. ""I am sure you are familiar with the word Antitype which a kind of being that has protection from immortals. That basically means we cannot die from immortals. Meaning they cannot kill us. This also means we are God Slayers which is another reference that is used to explain who we are. We come from the Original Dimension but I still haven't found out why we reign from there. All I know is that the Original Dimension is where the Spirits reside. Strange since we are not deities yet we are protected from them. I need you to keep my existence a secret. Mind if I roleplay as this Ranathia so that I may protect my identity until I gather more information and fulfill my purpose? Also, you may ask any questions you want of me. I'm not sure I will have the answers for you, but I will still try to answer to the best of my ability."" </s>"
155,"<s>[INST] The bell rung and class for the day was over with the students filing out to either leave the school or look at the field left behind from the fight. Alice glanced at those that stayed in the class for whatever reason and the sleeping passenger on her shoulder who show no indication of waking up. Should she try to wake her up? She's not sure she could walk around without having the small winged humanoid fell [/INST] off.... She should try to move her and hope she won't get offended. Using her other arm, Alice gently moved the fairy to the table. Luckily, no one seemed to notice.
Annenis stood up to look outside before returning to Alice, ""Hey, I'm going to ask if anyone saw who made the explosion from before, do you want to come along with me?"" She then looked towards Nathan. ""You too Spikey, do you want to come along?"" </s>"

He then took the talisman, the pendant that looked like tree with its leaves in the shape of a book, and placed it on his desk. ""This will get you started."" he said.
He then noticed something seemed wrong with Meira, however he was not sure what. He reasoned he shouldn't interfere until the problem became immediate or until he understood it. It would also allow him to monitor how the others would react to this. </s>"

""Well, just the two of us then?"" Annenis asked.
""Yes, I'll come with you,"" Alice replied with a nod. ""Where are we starting?""
""Find other witnesses, duh!"" Annenis said, grabbing one of Alice's ar [/INST] m and started to drag her out of the class.
""Eh? Anne, wait for a-"" Alice protested, momentarily looking at Meira, her desk and a certain figure sleeping on it.
""No time! People are going home!"" Was the reply as both girls disappeared into the halls.
Inside Alice's bag that was left behind on her desk, her phone chimed as it received a message. </s>"
158,"<s>[INST] Meira turned her attention toward Nathan as she jumped backward still under the influence of what was still controlling her. She looked at him then her eyes burned in anger. The fact Nathan interfered with her caused the anger inside her body to surge which caused her aura to erupt even more. Meira said toward him as her voice become very sinister, ""Evil must die. Infidels who use others for their own self-satisfaction are anomalies that must be erased. Any kind of corrupted being does not have the right to exist.""
""Nathan, you fool."" A girl's voice called out as they left the room they were in. They revealed themselves to be Reala when they came into plain view. Reala was a bit irritated that Nathan was acting like this was some sort of small problem. He had no idea that Meira was not herself and that some [/INST] kind of influence was controlling her mind at the moment. ""That is not Meira. Listen to her and look at her. Do you actually think that is being caused by a simple headache? Don't be so naive..."" She said as she looked into Meira's eyes which glowed a diablo blue color like she was being possessed by something.
Meira charged up her energy as she still faced Nathan the put her palm forward shooting for a shockwave at him only to have Reala deflect it by getting in the way of it. Meira looked at Reala who had a very serious look on her face and looked to her very scary. ""Why, why..."" She murmured under her breath not understanding why they would interfere with was she was about to do. It was obvious her rage still clouded her judgment and blinded her from seeing that she was being no different than they were. </s>"
159,"<s>[INST] Now, since you decided to possess one of my students, and harm others, the least you could do is name yourself entity. Squall said.
Rage Meira turned her eyes in his direction unaffected by Nathan pinning her. It seemed like if she wanted to that should could break free of his grasp but decided not to as her focus went directly on Squall. ""I am the Ouroboros of this Universe. I am the darkness known as Erebus that devours everything."" Meira went silent as glyphs glowed lightly all over her body which started to turn green in color. Rage Meira grinned as she made a shadow version of herself materialize right behind Reala in an attempt to stab her but it immediately dissipated when Meira screamed on the top of her lungs, ""STOP IT!!

""What do you mean controlling you? You summoned me forth when you were enraged about a group of students beating on some pathetic mortal. You allowed this happen to yourself."" The darker half of her said to Meira as Meira continued to resist the darkness from trying to take full control of her.
Rage Meira once again assumed control of her body then focused her attention on Nathan. She smirked at Nathan thinking it was amusing that he thought he could so easily contain the mass of her power with just sheer brute force. She shook her head as she continued, ""Do you really think it's that easy, boy? Why do mortals have to be so full of themselves and stupid at the sametime?"" </s>"

'But if he's even the smallest bit right about just what this thing is...then any attempt to get it out of Meria that I make is likely to backfire. That really sucks. Why couldn't this be some garden variety spirit? I could deal with that no problem.' Nathan grumbled. Something about this whole situation just set [/INST] him off. Maybe it was just the last in a long line of straws, or a really big one, but this was the straw that broke his back ""and just why should I believe a word you say?"" He demanded of the strange man who had just walked in ""I have no idea who you even are. The only words I've ever heard come out of you mouth was some condescending remarks that, to be honest, I droned in and out of after the fist sentence you said. So I'll ask again; why the hell should I trust some asshole I've never met before? Oh, and do try to answer without some kind of smart alack response. Otherwise I might have trouble paying attention to you."" </s>"

He yelled as he palmed his hand forward to prevent Nathan from being able to move from his current location by blasting a surge of energy at him. He isolated Nathan's movement so he could not move his feet. His eyes began to glow and energy began to surge out of his body and fill the room. He took a look at Nathan with a very serious gaze in his eyes as he was about to give him instructions and he would either follow those instructions or find out what he was about to do. ""Knock Meira unconscious. If you do not I will stop time and do it myself. I already isolated your movement. If you even try to move the gravity will increase slowly feeling like you are being crushed. I am not playing around, kid. Knock her out or I will do it myself! I'm not in the mood to listen to your stupid mouth when we are in danger of being spirited away by her runes. Look at them!"" He said as he pointed toward her body and her body started to glow a pale green color as runes started to envelop her body. Nathan had one choice and it was to do exactly as he said o [/INST] r find out what was about to happen. Sentius reversed the magnetic force around Nathan making it so his feet were magnets. He was stuck to the floor unable to move. He had also changed the gravitational force in case Nathan did anything stupid.
""Don't even try to move from your location. As long as I am producing a strong magnetic pull you aren't going anywhere. I'm tired of playing games so I'm going to make this very simple for you. If you struggle and don't do as I say it will just get worse and the gravitational pull will increase feeling like you're being crushed. You only need your hands so use them. If you do not knock her unconscious I will snap my fingers and you will not know what happened. Test me if you want to find out. I'm not playing around! YOU DONE PISSED ME OFF AND NOW YOU ARE GOING TO FIND OUT HOW DANGEROUS MY POWER REALLY IS IF YOU DARE DEFY ME!!!"" He said letting his energy get even more intense where the gravitational force slowly began to increase which would make it unbearable for Nathan if he waited too long. He had one option or have Shinrei take the matter into his own hands. </s>"
162,"<s>[INST] Sentius no! Reala pleaded knowing what he was about to do. The last thing she wanted him to do was release the full power of the Primordial Lightning Awakening. It could destroy everyone in the room and all to just show Nathan that is was being an idiot who was jumping to conclusions. Sentius released his spell on Nathan at her request and then she stood in front of Sentius moving quickly over toward his direction acting as a guard for him.
Sentius wanted to show this mouthy child how much of a fool he really was, but that would have to wait. He had other things he needed to do and he had wasted enough time with this fool in front of him. He closed his eyes since this fool in front of him is supposed to be rumored to be the one he was supposed to be looking for. He refused to believe that since this child was so naive that they immediately jumped to conclusions. Not only that, everything that seem to come out of his mouth is a bunch of nonsense.
Reala called Celesna toward her side then gripped the sword with her hand standing between her and Nathan barring any path he had toward Sentius. ""I am under orders to not let any harm come toward Sentius. You may protect my sister Nathan, but don't make me kill you over your foolishness. Any harm comes toward Sentius and a full-scale war between Gaea and the EP will escalate. What then!? Is your stupid conspiracy theory nonsense worth invoking a war over? If so then you're more disgusting than I thought and you have no right to be with my sister. You invoke those god damn words again I will kill you where you stand. I will kill any threat who wants to bring war. I will ensure that the peace remains and destroy worthless scum like you who don't know their own authority or place."" She said irritated with Nathan's actions as she stood where she was. Reala was very serious about her words, she flashed her sword into an attack position. She would kill Nathan right where he stood if he even dare try to approach Sentius.
""Stupid mortal!"" A voice said as she shot a lightning bolt and electrocuted Nathan with it before even had a chance to make an action and made the charge respond toward his pain receptors where Nathan could feel it quite clearly. It was none other than the fairy that had fallen asleep on Alice's desk. This time she had revealed her true self in front of everyone, but she was still wearing that uniform from earlier. ""I was sleeping just fine until you woke me up with your tenacity. Are you mortals really that stupid? Hah, I knew it! All you care about is war, isn't that right dragon fool mortal?"" She questioned as she grabbed Nathan by the shirt and brought him closer to peer into her eyes which were full of fury. She was very angry since she was enjoying such a peaceful dream only to be woken up by Nathan's bantering. This fueled her rage and made her shoot a powerful lightning bolt right directly at him. ""You pledge to protect her over what, invoking a galactic war? Do you really want to devour everything that may be a threat to her? Because if you do you are the terrorist, Nathan. Stop it with your st [/INST] upid words because you're so contradictory it's disgusting. You mortals have taught me absolutely nothing new other than you act like a bunch of idiots. That is all I have learned. You aren't allowed to talk either. You're like fuel for the fire so just shut up listen for once!"" Stellvia said she placed a magic circle underneath Nathan which would absorb his voice so nobody could hear it right after she tossed him to the ground taking Meira away from him and cradling her in her arms. That way he could for once learn to listen analyze everything properly and actually allow someone to slap some sense into that thick head of his. ""I don't really care who is who. The one that is causing the most problem is you, Nathan. Though that other guy over there I don't care who he is either isn't helping. All I know is your constant whining just woke me up and now you will have to suffer my wrath for doing so."" She then did the same thing to Sentius. Sentius tried to block her spell, but due to her superior form he could not overpower her.
""Now all you two need to do is listen. You aren't helping either of yourselves by insulting each other so why not for a change why don't we take this from the top. You two will properly introduce yourselves or else you will suffer my wrath until you do. Do I make myself perfectly clear?"" Sentius nodded at the frightening woman which did send some chills down his spine. ""Good."" She added as she turned her attention toward Nathan and gave him the same scary stare she gave Sentius. It was the same stare Ranathia gave Nathan and this being had some kind of relation toward her but that was unknown. ""That means you too, Nathan. Just nod. Shut your god damn filthy tyrannical mouth and just listen to reason and enlightenment. You're both acting like a bunch of children. So I guess Mother has to take over and discipline the both of you. Don't either of you waste your time trying to escape me. You touch that barrier and it will send unbearable painful sensations through your body.""
""I will take care of Meira for the time being. It doesn't seem either of you are fit for the task as you both endanger her well-being. Sentius you're aggressiveness and Nathan you're jumping to conclusions without knowing the consequences of those conclusions, reckless behavior and actions and your filthy mouth doesn't help. My authority outranks yours as I am a deity. Neither of you have any reason to doubt or oppose my authority."" She added as she turned toward Alice and Annenis asking for a request. ""I want Meira to stay with you and your weird companion for awhile. That way I can watch over her while these two heathens learn to either get along or never get to see her again."" Turning her eyes toward Squall to exercize her authority with a cold look in her eyes she looked for no objections from even him. ""I trust you are fine with this? A deity is certainly more gentle than these two ruffians. I suggest you keep them in line from now on."" She concluded as she caused her wings to appear on her backside which were six wings that were arranged and butterfly colored. </s>"

Outside some people could be seen having a walk, one of t [/INST] hem, well known to the kids was Professor Jacob wearing green sneakers and black shorts and t-shirt having his morning run, which against what would be expected was not that fast.

She preferred nature and the outdoors to staying inside, and it could cure her of any foul mood. So when the entry way to the arena came into view, Lucky smiled to herself. She hated the classes involving powers, but she wouldn't be deterred from her good mood.
When the familiar face of Lady Jade came into view, Lucky gave her a double-snap and finger guns hand gesture. ""Hey Lady J', how's it hangin'?"" Lucky called out, not expecting a reply from the teacher in question as she walked past, already knowing what to do. She took her place next to a much shorter, rather cute girl. ] Lucky pondered, looking out of the corner of her left eye at Elaine. Out of habit rather than conscious thought, Lucky stroked her chin with a thick strand of tentacle-esque hair as she tried to figure [/INST] out Elaine's actual name.
Lucky noted how uncomfortable Elaine seemed, but Lucky couldn't blame her. Everyone here had their own demons to deal with. With a shrug, she leaned against the wall casually and pulled down her headphones, the cheery music from within filling the air in a sphere of a couple of feet around Lucky. ""It'll be over with before you know it."" She said, aiming the comment towards Elaine. ""I'm Lucky... Like, that's actually what people call me, go figure."" She chuckled to herself, enjoying the joke even if nobody else got it. ""Anyways, don't worry. Lady J' has this situation under control, nobody will get hurt. Probably."" She added with a wink and a toothy grin. Her teeth glowed the same color as her neon green, bio-luminescent hair, giving the smile a weird effect.
She leaned back to give Elaine room, but kept her headphones hanging loosely around her neck in case the shorter girl wanted to talk at all. She hummed quietly to the music. </s>"

Getting to know the place, and enjoying the pleasant weather, walking around the grounds he took in how appreciative he was to be here, this place was a safe haven for people like him, but for him it was literally a place to get away. As he showed up at the arena he sat outside of it for sometime pacing, he knew he would have to show off his power which would be very very difficult. Working up the nerve finally he entered the arena.
Some of the others were funneling in, and beneath him on the floor of the arena was one of the teachers. He took a seat near a couple of girls. ""Hell [/INST] o ladies, haven't seen you around before. Names Eric."" He flashed them his best grin. ""You ready to strut your stuff?"" He said, to be honest he was nervous so instead he decided to chat them up hoping that they would help take it easy on his nerves.
As time went on Eric got more and more jittery, it almost looked like he was going to try to and bolt. With such a useless power, he probably wouldn't really fit in here. They might even kick him out, it's not like he could summon the elements, or manipulate objects with his mind. He sighed aloud and leaned back. ""Teachers cute though."" He laughed at his own joke, and started to fidget a little more. </s>"

Kaze looked around at the bright halls and rich decor as he moved through the facility. He had been told to go to the Arena but the place was hard for him to get around still. He kind of missed the forest and the simplicity it involved. He got the odd look from the people he passed, but that was because of the massive cloak that hid his entire body from view. It also didn't help that he literally towered over everyone he came across. Still he had places to go so he inhaled. He found the teachers scent and followed it with that odd animalistic lope.
Upon arriving he peeked into the room. Students were lined up around the Arena with Lad [/INST] y Jane in the middle. The room was well lit so he had no way of just sneaking in and avoiding the eyes of the other students like his instincts were telling him to. Snuffing he started into the room, each step was a dull thud thanks to his weight. But the others could hear clicks after he walked, it was the claws hidden from sight drumming lightly on the ground.
He kept away from the other students but he heard their whispers. Either about him or about Lady Jane's appearance. He ignored it though and kept his dully glowing crimson eyes on the teacher. Aside from the snuff he had made no sound, to either greet or just jabber like the others. </s>"

If Lain was honest, the comment did little to calm her beating heart but the idea of it was more soothing than not. Even if everything were under control, she still didn't like the idea of being around others or possible showing off her powers. It didn't sit well with her at all.
Lucky paused for a moment, looking Elaine over. ""You may want to relax and take some deep breaths. You seem pretty nervous. Is this your first class at the Haven?""
Lain stood still for a moment, thinking about how she wanted to answer Lucky when another student came up to greet them. He looked oddly normal. She was still staring at Eric when she answered Lucky's question, ""Y-Yes...""
However, was she really ready to 'strut her stuff' as Eric had asked? A frown formed on La [/INST] in's face as she quietly turned away and stared down at the floor again. ""N-No... She mumbled quietly to herself, though she was almost certain her responses would confuse both students.
""Teachers cute though."" She heard Eric laugh. The comment prompted her to look back up at the teacher before settling her gaze back down at the floor, her movements slow and cautious. The teacher still intimidated her so she couldn't look past the fear to see the appeal. ""Yeah..."" She replied softly, a lie but she didn't really feel like explaining herself and agreeing usually meant less talking.
The thud of another new coming prompted Lain to look up once again and her eyes widened at the sight. What the heck was that... thing? She blinked, staring at him for a moment before her face softened as she once again reminded herself of the looks people often gave her after she transformed back from an episode.

So, that was what his phone's alarm sounded like. He would have never known if he had not come to this place. He was used to having some attendant entering his spacious room and calling for him to wake up every morning, so having that done by a piece of technology instead only served as a reminder that things were probably never going to be the same.
The events that had led up to him ending up at the Haven had seemed surreal, almost unbelievable. The staff member who had pick him up had seen everything, and despite the teenager's pleas for them not do so, had contacted his family and informed them of the situation. The Ryders, obviously concerned for their family's status, immediately requested that Cole st [/INST] ay at the Haven and away from home, and it hurt to hear that. Of course, he had expected such a reaction from his parents, but it still hurt.
Cole's newly-discovered ability of heightened senses of hearing and smell only made the new environment more overwhelming as he made his way through the school towards the big arena, where his first lesson was scheduled to take place at. The other students were loud and rowdy. Did they really have to shout to one another? The hallways seemed to reek of grime, sweat, and remnants of what smelt like gas released through the- well, he did not even want to think about it.
Needless to say, the entire experience had left him somewhat frustrated by the time he had reached the big arena, though he did manage a ""Good morning, Ma'am,"" and a polite bow to the teacher present before trudging over to stand with the other students. </s>"

Instead of interrogating Elaine further, Lucky gave Eric a cheeky grin when he asked if they were ready to strut their stuff. ""Oh hells yes am I ready to strut it! You aren't even prepared for this beautimus performance."" She fanned her hair out behind her in a striking resemblance of a peacock's tail feathers and twirled around gracefully. When she was done, she struck a sassy pose with one hand on her hip.
In response to Eric's remark about Lady Jade being cute, Lucky nodded like the comment was expected. After all, in her many years attending the school she had heard a lot of praise, as well as an equal amount of vitriol, for the teacher. ""Yea [/INST] h, Lady J' is something else. This should be an interesting class, to say the least..."" She trailed off distractedly as she followed Elaine's line of sight to the new students, especially to Kaze.
She wasn't completely unprepared for oddities, but Kaze's existence was pretty distracting. When a girl with an attitude placed herself next to the giant, Lucky frowned, sensing a fight brewing. She hesitantly tore her attention back to Eric and Elaine. That was when she noticed Cole standing not too far away, and she gave him a smile and a wave, including him in the small gathering.
""Hopefully this doesn't get too interesting though... That girl over there seems like trouble."" Lucky indicated Eira with a nod and a shrug. ""Oh yeah, I'm Lucky by the way."" She added as an after-thought, finally remembering to introduce herself. ""Let's hope we all stay that way, too."" </s>"

But he was getting side tracked, he was going to talk to the giant.
He stood up and was about to yell something to him, when another student entered the room. She was cute, but boy did she lo [/INST] ok like she woke up on the wrong side of the bed today. And Eric did not like the way she treated giant guy, so instead of letting it slide quietly he interfered, which he would probably regret later but ice queen needed to back down. ""Hey, leave him alone! There is absolutely no need to be a bitch about it."" He shouted, he walked from his section of the stands over to where the other two were standing.

Lastly and trying to show of her strength arrived Eira, the last one to arrive was Cole.

Then again, she was practically trying to disappear on the spot.
She lifted her head when the teacher started talking, but the entire situation was making her nervous. She felt hot and a little bit nauseous.

""Don't you dare fucking pick me up again."" Her voice, as it had been throughout this little encounter, was cold, icy, and dark. A slight blush surfaced on her cheeks as her shoulders twitched a little. Bad memories began to surface, but with an iron will she shoved them back down. For god's sake, the streets of New York was no place for a girl to grow up.
About to spit some other vehement comment out, Eira was cut short by the professor's words. Scowling, she turned towards the bloody teacher, of course, not want [/INST] ing to go back to where she came from, Eira kept her mouth shut. Waiting, she watched as the dragon took off his cloak. Damnit, for a big scaly giant, he was rather attractive. Snarling, she responded to Professor Jade.
""Oi! If I could keep it bottled up I would. Do you have any idea what it feels like to never have a hot meal in your life?!?!"" Eira's voice echoed around the arena, carrying itself down to the professor in the center of the ground. Crossing her arms, Eira leaned back against the metal railing that stood behind her. Shooting daggered glares at both the teacher and the lizard, Eira's flames coiled around the metal. Soon, the once glossy railing became foggy with a thin layer of ice. </s>"

His initial impression of her was that she was loud and a tad hyperactive, but at least she was pleasant. A light smile crossed his face as he looked towards her and nodded, intending to be polite. Her attention, as well as that of another boy in the group then turned to a little situation some distance away from them. He thought it unnecessary for the boy to interfere when he was not part of it. After all, that was what teachers were for, were they not?
The female teacher who had started to address the students was soon joined by a male one, whom she had introduced as 'Professor Jacob'. She then briefed the group on the lesson that was about to take place, giving some specific instructions to a couple of students, namely the two involved in the earl [/INST] ier incident. The tall figure in the cloak complied without objection, and revealed himself to be a dragon-like beast. Well, that had shown Cole that he was not the only monster around. The girl, however, could only imply that she had trouble controlling her ability. She did so while maintaining her aggressive demeanor, and Cole could not help but be curious about how the teacher would respond to that.
Switching his focus back to the class, he figured that he had quite a clear idea of what was going to happen. It was a safe environment to use his ability, and all he had to do was ensure he did not stay a monster for longer than ten minutes. He would have been self-conscious about the nature of his ability, if not for the fact that he knew that he was around a group of people who were 'gifted' themselves.
""Understood, Ma'am,"" was all he felt the need to say in reply to the teacher. </s>"

When she mentioned the giant should take off his cloak, he turned to look at him and saw that he was actually a dragon-man hybrid thing. ""Okay, cool..."" He said, his voice filled with awe from looking at the dragon man. Before, he could ask what the teacher meant by working as a team, the dragon man picked up the ice queen and set her down on the other side of him. This caused Eric to laugh at loud, and then in between laughs he managed to utter. ""Both of you are so hopeless."" He stopped laughing, and started to go back to his seat.
It was at this point that he saw the ice queen was getting legitimately angry so he stepped between the two o [/INST] f them, he could see the look on her face. Eric probably shouldn't of stepped between the two of them, out of both of them his powers were probably the weakest. He could probably fight a normal human, but someone like dragon-man, and more than likely the ice queen over there could probably tear him to shreds. ""I don't think you two should be fighting yet, maybe you'll get lucky and get paired up then you can beat the tar out of each other. But there are people in the crossfire here, so how bout the both of you come sit down with us.""

""Then don't presume to order me."" He stated before his eyebrow quirked upward. He noticed the blush and was confused about it. Her verbal reaction didn't go with the blush, so was she hiding something? She'd reveal it when she reveals it, for now he didn't make a comment. He also made sure to notice her flames didn't produce heat. They were the source of the cold [/INST] ness given the railing she leaned against.
The boy from earlier laughed and spoke up. Hopeless? He hadn't done anything threatening nor did he even give off the inkling of anger. The teen even stepped between the two as if they were about to just assault each other. Frost girl spoke up grumpily, mentioning never having hot food. Probably because of her ability. ""We're not fighting. She's saying her grievances and I'm ignoring her attitude."" he said. They would know if he was upset or not even with his reptilian and animalistic face. </s>"
181,"<s>[INST] Eira took a deep breath, the blush rapidly draining from her cheeks as the guy that spoke earlier jumped between her and the dragon. Her nearly black eyes stared up at him as her flames inked their way by his feet. Stepping up to him, she spoke.
""A fight? We were just having a nice conversation."" Malice was heavy in her voice as a twisted, but attractive, smile spread across her lips. ""But, you really shouldn't get in other people's ways."" She said, keeping the smile on her face. Then [/INST] , in the blink of an eye, the temperature of her flame, the one that had snaked its way by Eric's leg, dropped. The air began to condense around the man's leg making a thick, impenetrable fog. Winter had descended.
Turning her attention back towards the dragon, she spoke again. ""How about, Scales? Wanna have a go?"" Now something reflecting true mirth found its way into the icy menace of her voice.
(Eric doesn't get hurt from the flames, it just gets really bloody cold around his legs.) </s>"
182,"<s>[INST] Enough! yelled Jade as her eyes turne golden. Kaze, Eira, and Eric felt there body trapped in time, they couldn't move, even the cold flames seemed to freeze in time. Eric's leg wasn't neither more cold or more warm, the temperature seemed to stop going down, but it was getting warmer either. The trio could still hear, breathe, and think, but their bodies would not move.
""No one inside this school will use their powers or fight because of childish behavior or diversity of opinions. But seeing that K [/INST] aze and Eira so kindly volunteered they are going to be the first pair to duel each other. When I release you take two steps back and then take position in opposite sides of the arena. After you introduce yourself to the adversary and bow you can start. The rest of you take place outside the arena and watch carefully as the battle goes. Questions will be asked in the end. I hope that I've made myself clear."" As she finished her eyes went back to their normal color and the trio could once again move. </s>"
183,"<s>[INST] Eric sighed, and shivered a bit as he felt the cold biting at his ankles. As he was about to say something, then he couldn't move the teacher had frozen him somehow, Ice queen, and Dragon-man as well. He let out another drawn out sigh before listening to what Lady J had to say, when she released him he stepped out of the way. ""Was just trying to make sure no one got caught in the crossfire, it's actions and temperaments like that, that make people hate us."" He spoke with just the slightest [/INST] hint of anger behind his voice.
As he sat down he was still shaking, he was lucky this time Ice bitch hadn't tried to kill him. He knew he shouldn't of gotten involved, but sitting there and watching probably would of been worse if the teachers didn't interfere in time. He couldn't wait to watch them fight though, he was thinking about taking bets but he didn't think the teachers would be all that happy about it, but nonetheless he spoke. ""Go dragon dude!"" He said, to no one in particular. </s>"
184,"<s>[INST] Kaze
Kaze blinked slowly when the girl put her power on the guys legs because he stepped in the way. She was obviously looking for a fight considering she just called him out. A brief inhale and he blew out, sending her flame sputtering. ""Don't push be, girl."" He stated calmly, that odd multi-toned voice going a little low. She had just attacked someone for trying to stop a fight without even harming her. That obviously didn't sit well with him, but Jade finally intervened. The cold girl, Eira, and Kaze would be sparring first.
When he was released he went to the arena and turned to face the much sma [/INST] ller cold woman. ""I'm Kaze."" He said before bowing. After she introduced herself he shoved himself backwards with his wings, putting distance between himself and her. The ground cracked under his weight while deep ruts were in the ground from that shove. ""I'd advise you to take this very serious."" he said as his wing dug into the ground and sent a chunk of the stadium floor towards Eira. The other wing swept along the ground, kicking up a dust cloud that could easily hide him. He didn't need his eyes to know where she was, his ears were already swiveling, cutting out the sounds of the other students. </s>"
185,"<s>[INST] Sarah walked across the grounds, trying to look like she belonged there. Which wasn't easy, considering she'd arrived less than an hour earlier. She had been given half an hour to put her bags in her room and get a feel for the place, and then the girl had returned to give her directions to the arena for her first lesson.    Sarah chuckled at the thought, as she approached the building the girl had indicated. Before entering the arena, Sarah entered the bathroom. She ran the tap and let the cool water wash over her hands. Feeling cooler, more composed, she reluctantly turned off the water, dried her hands by running them through her hair and took a deep breath.   
Sarah [/INST] entered the arena just as an enormous dragonlike creature dug his wing into the ground and tossed part of the arena towards a tiny looking girl on the other side of the arena. She then looked around for the other students. Some had sat down to enjoy what was obviously going to be a fight, others were still standing around. One girl seemed to feel right at home, camera and trailmix in hand, she seemed ready to enjoy the spectacle.   
Sarah wasn't sure what to do. She had been warned that class had already started, but this wasn't exactly what she had pictured. In the end, she decided to go with what the girl with the wicked hair was doing and sat down somewhere behind her. </s>"
186,"<s>[INST] Eira moved along with Kaze when the teacher finally released them. She was mumbling something about not even touching the other guy as she dropped down into the Arena. Walked towards the center, She let Kaze introduce himself. WHich she did in turn with a bow. Then, almost immediately, Kaze was on the other side of the arena and huge chunk of dirt and stone was flying towards her face. Quickly she dodged out of the way, which is not something that you would expect from somebody with the average body temperature of ice.
Scowling, Eira got up from her knees, her fla [/INST] mes spread out in a twenty foot wide circle. Within this circle, it was pitch black. Nobody could see into as all the light within had been devoured by icy flames. The temperature had dropped significantly too. Well past -200 degrees celsius, ice fell to the ground as condensation took over. A snarl adorned Eira's pale lips as she moved towards Kaze. Somehow, she could see through her own flames.
She ran towards the dragon, who was hopefully stupified by her flames. She was attempting to get close, and if she managed to do that Eira hoped to wrap Scales in flames. </s>"
187,"<s>[INST] Kaze
Kaze couldn't see her flames, but she couldn't see him either thanks to the cloud of dust he had raked up. She just had his general area. But he could hear her coming, each step was like an echo that showed him where she was despite his blindness. Just as she took another step he drove both his wings and his hands into the ground with a mighty crash that caused the ground in the arena to tremble. Just enough to make someone walking, or especially running, stumble.
The dust had cleared out enough he could see, and what he saw was her twenty foot ring of black fire that probably had her at the center. ""I'm sure you know what happens to things that freeze at a rapid pace."" He said, considering she had frosty capabiliti [/INST] es. Not to mention the actual ice that was forming wherever that black fire had been. He moved away from her flames and scooped up a chunk of the arena floor and lobbed it into her flames. The traces of water within it froze fast enough the stone actually exploded much like it would if someone had heated it up. Shards of rock were sent flying in numerous directions.
It was a spar of powers but his had always been strength and durability. He had to be tricky to even hurt the other girl since she could just cover a broad area with those cold flames. While she dealt with that though he wanted to test something. A swipe of his wing sent a wave of dirt into her flames. He honestly wanted to see if anything could 'douse' them. </s>"
188,"<s>[INST] Eira stumbled as the ground quaked underneath, however she managed to turn her stumble into a roll. And then the giant threw another rock at her. As it exploded, pieces of shrapnel went by her. Though she didn't get hurt because the ones that came towards her disintegrated into sand. Scowling, she watched as the dragon tried to fling sand onto her flames. They weren't normal flames though, and the sand just fell right on through them.
Walking to the outer edge of the cloud of flame, Eira stayed just [/INST] inside its black expanse. She, snarling, walked out of the flames. Only a few wisps covered her shoulders arms and legs as she walked forward towards the dragon. The rest of cloud fell flat against the floor, threatening to cover the ground of the entire arena. Just a few spaces at the edge was clear of the flame's touch.
THen, like a river, the thin layer of flame surged around the dragon, who was standing on clear ground. Hopefully, the -200 degrees celsius temp. would make his movements sluggish. </s>"
189,"<s>[INST] Kaze
Kaze took notes in his mind that he couldn't douse the flames in a traditional manner. Water would freeze, dirt did nothing, and he doubted he could blow them out like a candle. When the girl emerged, just some wisps of her black fire on her, he saw she was unhurt. Just a little dirty from the rock somehow reverting to its sediments. ""You snarl more than I do and I'm more bestial."" He stated with a dull look on his face. He was watching her flames, not her. They were the threat, otherwise she was just a normal girl. Granted she was the brains of it.
He made sure to keep away from the flames when they spread out. It seemed she could only control so much of it. So the [/INST] higher the fire the more narrow the diameter. The more shallow, the further it can spread. She didn't seem to be able to control where it went though since it didn't just drift towards the small bits of fire-free space he occupied.
When the icy flames surged towards him. He did one of the simplest things someone could do in that kind of situation. He jumped. Except his jump launched him fifty feet into the air where his wings snapped open to glide around. He was prolonging his air-time to see how she and her flames reacted. Would the flames follow him? Would she cloud him like she had the other guy? Or would she wait for him to land before renewing her freezing assault? </s>"
190,"<s>[INST] Cole's eyes widened slightly, admittedly finding the teacher's power to be rather impressive. Was it a form of chronokinesis, or just some sort of paralyzing ability? He figured that he could ask her at another time if really was curious about it. For now, she had just instructed the two involved in the earlier disagreement to pair up and be the first ones to demonstrate their powers. The boy who had tried to mediate the fight got out of the way as soon as he was free to do so, and the green-haired girl spoke again, her bubbly demeanor suddenly disappearing, but not her confidence. She gestured to some seats outside the arena before making her way over there.
""Take me with you,"" Cole muttered under his breath before walking out right after her, not wanting to be caught in anything those t [/INST] wo were about to throw at each other.
Cole could get quite a good view of the fight from outside the arena. He leaned forward in his seat, intensely watching the moves of the two individuals facing off. The dragon-like boy did not fail to surprise him as he tossed a piece of the ground at his opponent only with his wing. Cole could tell he was strong by simply looking at him, but he had no idea that he was that strong. The girl seemed to be a good match for him. Her flames spread across the area, allowing her to hide in darkness. The battle of both skill and wit continued, and Cole had to admit that the two were setting pretty high standards for the rest of them. He wondered how the rest would be paired, and especially who his opponent would be, but that would all be answered soon enough. </s>"
191,"<s>[INST] Eira smiled just a bit as she heard Scales' remark. ""Of course I snarl! I also Bite!"" She shouted up to him as he launched himself into the air. Then, she let her flames dissipate, smoky remains floating up in the air. Slowly, they reached just past Kaze. Then, without a moment's notice, they exploded into life. Black flames blotted out the sun as they casted shadow across the ground. A thin tendril reached up from Eira into the thin cloud far above. The temperature, still at 1200 degrees celsius made the air heavy. It pushed down on the dragon, hopefully causing him t [/INST] o lose his balance in the air. Then, ice formed, needles, thin and long, rained down above Kaze.
Eira's arms were crossed as her hooded head was cocked up at the airborne drake. Locks of pure white snow fell out of her hood as a twisted smile spread across her face. 'Believers' by Imagine Dragons was blasting in her earbuds. Of which only one was actually in her ear. The difference in air pressures and temperature made several gusts of wind fly through the arena. Those winds whipped at her clothes and hair. Eira's brown eyes watched as the dragon reacted to her assault. </s>"
192,"<s>[INST] Kaze
Kaze gave off a low chuckle. ""I wouldn't advise biting me, you'll break your teeth."" He said as he watched the wisps float up into the air. He had expected her to have the flames follow him and was not surprised when the fire was floating in the air. The cool air was pushing down on him and he didn't really react much, just that the gliding was accelerated. When the ice started forming into needles his wings tucked in and he landed on the ground while the needles bounces harmlessly off his scales.
All her fire seemed to be in the air but he was figuring she could dissipate what was up there and make it appear around her. So he didn' [/INST] t just send himself flying into her. No, he did something a little better. His wings swung back before launching forward, sending a powerful gale of wind towards her. He also knew that if he did actually strike her she'd be very injured and then he'd be in trouble, so he was showing a great deal of restraint.
The gale picked up any stray litter, like pebbles, sand, and dust. If the material actually got to her it'd feel like sandpaper was being brushed furiously across her skin. Those huge powerful wings cocked back and sent another gale, a stronger one. It looked like he was aiming to just slam her into the arena wall with wind pressure. </s>"
193,"<s>[INST] Eira smiled as the dragon did what she wanted him to do. ""Scales! I won't break my teeth if you turn to ice!"" SHe shouted as he sent a gale towards her. However, it never reached her. Her flames didn't dissipate, they fell. Right on top of the dragon and his winds. However, she did have to take a step back as the initial gale hit her, scraping at her skin with sand. It was uncomfortable and extremely painful.
Snarling as a faint streak of blood showed just underneath her right eye, Eira regained her footing. Crouchin [/INST] g down she secured herself in case he managed to get another gale off from underneath her flames. However, when she touched the ground with her fingertips, Eira recoiled in pain. The tips of her fingers were red and sensitive. She was exerting herself. She was already at the limit of the amount of flames she could control at any one time, but Eira was still pushing it. She had..maybe thirty minutes before frostbite began to eat away at her fingers and toes. Well, she would just have to finish this battle before then. </s>"
194,"<s>[INST] Kaze
Eira could see the muscular draconic mans body steam when her flames came into contact with him. Actually the first time she even touched him with the flames. He could feel the cold but he had a couple precious minutes to get out before drowsiness hit him. So like at the start he launched himself away. Except instead of away from her he moved towards her while she regained her footing. His tail, which hadn't been doing much this whole spar, snaked out like a s [/INST] erpent and coiled around her legs.
His body was still steaming, the frost that had formed on him melted into droplets of water. ""Concede, I can cripple you before you can freeze me."" He stated. If his arms and wings could flip and throw boulders his tail, which was pure muscle and bone, could probably do more feats of strength.
(I honestly wasn't really sure what to do except move in and use the tail XD I don't really wanna end it but it's all I could think of x.x) </s>"
195,"<s>[INST] Eira laughed as the dragon's tail snatched at her legs. ""Scales, you made a mistake,"" Her icy laugh rang out as black flames burst out form around her legs. Condensed and small, their temperature quickly fell to under 300 degrees celsius. If the dragon didn't move quickly, his tail would burn up in the cold.
Eira hoped the bloody giant would let up soon. She didn't want to hurt him too [/INST] badly. Kaze was pretty cool after all. However, much more importantly, if he didn't let up soon, then her legs would probably break. She already wanted to scream from the pain. Instead, she bit down on her lips. A small drop of blood appeared on the rim of her lips as she strained to keep up her fierce smile.
However, before any true harm came to either student, the teachers intervened. </s>"
196,"<s>[INST] I think we have seen enough.  Lady Jade's eyes turned golden again and with a few movements of arms the two students were back where they were right after they bowed at each other. Their wounds were healed, but the fatigue was there, and mo [/INST] re than the fatigue of the energy spent in battle it seemed like all the wounds they had taken during the fight turned into extra fatigue, it was a draw back from Lade Jade's Reverse Battle ability.
 ""You both fought well. How do you feel?"" </s>"
197,"<s>[INST] Kaze
Kaze just gave off a low chuckle. ""I did say I can crush your legs before you can freeze me. I have a high core temperature."" He said while noticing her biting her lip, drawing blood. Clearly she wasn't the type to give into pain. His tail was going numb but sheer will was keeping it nice and tight. Of course now Jade stepped in and they were frozen again, then back to their starting points. The numbness was gone along with any chill he had, but some tiredness as if he healed quickly lingered.
Blinking a bit he turned his attent [/INST] ion from Eira to Jade. ""I feel fine, ma'am. A bit tired but you know my stamina."" He said, he had done numerous classes with her before and he was a stamina freak. It seemed all of his powers related to his body and nothing else. High strength, endurance, and stamina were his thing. A shame he didn't follow a little more draconic lore like a breath weapon. Then again he was still young so something might pop up later. His crimson gaze went to Eira and he gave her a rather toothy grin. ""That was fun though, not many cold users around."" </s>"
198,"<s>[INST] Eira gasped as she suddenly became tired from Professor Jade's powers. Standing back at the other end of the stadium, her flames wisped around her form as she began to walk towards the stadium. Smiling back at the dragon, she spoke.
""Same to you Scales. There aren't many who can take my abilities like that.""
The blood that h [/INST] ad shown up on her lip was gone now, along with the cut that had been under her eye. However, she still felt happier than usual. She had gotten to go all out with someone else, and he hadn't gotten hurt.
""We should do this again sometime."" Eira's voice, while still icy, no longer held the malice that had bled from it earlier. </s>"
199,"<s>[INST] Next duel will be Cole and Lain. As you could see we are here and we will intervene before drastic damage is caused so don't be afraid to use and explore the full extend of your powers, this is a rare opportunity that you have here and that you might never had before. Once again I remind you, there are special reasons wh [/INST] y the pairs were made as they were, and at least the two of you will understand why as soon as the battle starts.  Compared to Lady Jade's, professor Jacob's voice was sweet and kind.
""You know the rules, edges of the arena, introduce yourselves, bow and duel!"" Said Jacob as he gestured the students to come to the arena. </s>"
200,"<s>[INST] Slowly, what was going on dawned on Sarah. She realized she was at a serious disadvantage here. There was no water in sight, and she was sure she would not be able to draw it from the plumbing system without ripping this apart.   
She tried to keep her cool as more students joined them to wa [/INST] tch the next match. Neither of the teachers had given any indication that they knew she'd arrived. She was wondering if they'd been able to pair her with anyone. A sudden surge of hope ran through her.    She took another deep breath and tried to concentrate on the spectacle in front of her. </s>"
201,"<s>[INST] Kaze
Kaze stretched out a bit as he moved out of the arena, listening to the names of the next sparing partners. He attention turned to Eira when she spoke before giving a low chuckle. ""I'm at a constant one hundred fifty degrees so your powers take a little longer to affect me. If I sunbath I peak at two hundred."" He explained as they moved to the seats for the arena. She mentioned doing it again which got a shrug from him. ""Maybe, but we'd need Ms. Jade to oversee it so neither o [/INST] ne of us gets hurt. I did hold back on just rushing into you."" He stated while giving her a serious look.
She had seen how he fought and how he reacted to her strategy. If he had actually been trying to hurt her, or kill her, he'd probably have done it in the first rush. It was why he hadn't reacted to her goading when she first came into the arena. She could still move her flames away so they didn't hurt anyone, he was always physically able to hurt people since he was his powers. </s>"
202,"<s>[INST] SMiling, Eira mulled over the problem of Kaze's bulk. Well, she had been holding back too. WHile she was at the limit of her powers being stable, Eira could have easily doubled the amount of flames she was using. Turning back to the dragon as they mounted the stairs of the stadium, she spoke.
""Well, Scales, we'll just have to see, won't we?"" A knowing smile, one that was easily scheming, spread across [/INST] her lips as she turned towards the dragon. However, the smile drained from her face as a slight blush took over. Eira, surprisingly, was noticing that the dragon was half-naked for the first time. Turning away, she snarled in her words, ""Put a damn shirt on, ya fuckin behemoth.""
Walking away, Eira chose a seat about halfway up the stadium. She looked down into the stadium waiting for the next spectacle. </s>"
203,"<s>[INST] Kaze
Kaze gave a rather hearty laugh when she blushed and snarled out her next words. ""they don't have a big and giant. Plus the wings."" He said with a grin. Oh he'd mess with her a little bit. ""Besides, are you sure you want all this hidden from sight?"" He asked while teasingly flexing at her. His already impressive bulk rippled from the movement as they tightened up underneath his scales. Down below all he wore was what amounted to a skirt, red in color with a golden border. Sort of like he half-assed a kimono.
He followed her up th [/INST] e stairs and situated himself on the bleachers in such a way that he'd be comfortable and not actually collapse the aluminum underneath him. ""So a shy girl and the silent wonder are up..."" He said, he never caught their names until Mr. Jacob said it and the boy had only spoken to the teachers. That he was aware of anyway. He didn't notice but others probably thought it was odd he'd sit near the girl who had been so grumpy and clearly violent. No point secluding her since she wasn't a bad person, and he liked being all big next to her. </s>"
204,"<s>[INST] Eira's eyes narrowed as she mumbled about arms and flexing reptiles. Pulling her knees up to her chin, Eira's hood fell over her head even more than previously. ""Who was called? This is my first day here so I don't know anyone."" Eira was curious about the two that were going down to the arena proper. She accidently picked a fight with someone that turned out to be a good match for her, so she wondered how good [/INST] of a match these two would be.
Then, turning over to Scales, she spoke again. ""Well, if they don't come in big and giant, then where the hell did you find the skirt?"" Eira's dark brown eyes narrowed even more at the dragon as locks of white hair fluttered in the wind. Her black flames circled around her folded body as music continued to blare from her earbuds. It was a wonder that she could hear anything at all. </s>"
205,"<s>[INST] Kaze
Kaze pointed to Elaine and Cole. ""Those two, both shifters of varying types. They get to turn back to normal though."" He said, a little bitter towards the end of it. It was hard to embrace what you were if you couldn't even be normal like most other mutants. He would be classed as a shifter as well but his seemed to be only one way and that was more draconic. When she turned and looked at [/INST] his he just shrugged his shoulders.
""Had someone who was better with cloth than I am turn a sumo wrestlers kimono into this. Beats the leather loincloth I was wearing before."" He said, obviously not disturbed or ashamed of anything related to nudity or clothing. He was half naked all the time. If it wasn't illegal he'd probably run around butt naked!

""Wha' 'ime is i'?"" Reading the screen, the young man groaned aloud. He was late...what he gets for going for a smoke straight out of bed. Ah well...he needed to sleep in anyway.
Climbing down at a slow pace, the oldest student in safe haven groaned,hitting the pavement with a thud. He stretched, his muscles straining as he rolled his joints. He gave a tug to his shirt, [/INST] trying to get the smell of smoke to atleast lessen. Teachers are gonna be on him again for smoking, but fuck 'em. He'll be takin' a hand before they take his smokes.
Checking his phone again, he sighed. Why does time seem to slow down on such boring days. He slept in and it still felt like it was going slow... ah well. Try and make it to class atleast...

207,"<s>[INST] Eric watched the back and forth between Dragon-Dude and Ice Queen go on for sometime, both of them never really seeming to get a leg up on the other. He was tempted to call it the fight of the century, but he had seen some good ones. ""Go dragon-Dude."" He shouted, raising his fist in the air in a show of solidarity. But alas the match ended with what could only be called a draw, he sighed and looked over at Cole and Elaine, wondering how they were gonna do on their duel.
But he didn't have time to process everything before a new girl arrived, and man did he have to get to know this girl. He stood, and sat next to the new girl. ""Hey, names Eri [/INST] c. What's yours?"" He asked smiling, when Luck offered the girl some trail mix he stuck his hand in the bag and popped some of the contents in his mouth. ""So kind of you, thanks."" He gave a half wave to Lucky and looked forward towards the arena as the challengers took their places. ""You've got this, good luck to the both of you."" He said, he was happy that he didn't have to fight yet. But he looked at both girls still in the stands, if he had to fight either of them he doubt he would be able to win. They probably had real powers, something that could end him in a heartbeat, or break his mind. Either way he wasn't looking forward to his fight. </s>"
208,"<s>[INST] Sarah jumped a little when a boy suddenly dropped down next to her, introduced himself and dove into the trailmix.
She smiled at the girl and said  ""Thanks, I'm sure that'll come in handy later!""  Before Eric could take another handful, she reached into the bag and accepted some goodies.  I'm Sarah by the way. These fights look intense! Good thing the teachers are here to make sure we don't get too messed up on our first days, right?  She knew she sounded nervous, but Sarah wasn't the type to pretend to be something she was not. She was excited to be here, but nervous at the same time because she wasn't sure what she should expect.
Sarah glanced at the two kids who had just had their first fight while [/INST] munching on her trailmix. They didn't look much worse for wear, which made her feel a little better. Fighting here was going to be hard, but at least she'd survive. In a sudden surge of understanding and sympathy, she called out  ""Go guys! You got this!""  to the next couple that had been called into the arena. She smiled at Eric, and the girl with the cool hair, and added in a softer voice  ""These are good, thanks.""  She suddenly realised she still didn't know the girl's name and added  ""What's your name? I can't keep referring to you as 'the girl with the cool hair' forever, can I?""  She blushed and decided to put another few pieces of trailmix in her mouth to stop her from spouting more silly stuff. </s>"

""That would be nice. To be normal and [/INST] not have a body temperature of 0 degrees celsius."" Eira's face became whistful as she looked up at Kaze. However, a joking smile soon appeared.
""What do you think you would look like if you became a normal person?"" </s>"

Kaze glanced at Eira when she echoed something he said. ""Be glad you can't really feel the cold. Could go out during winter in a bikini."" He joked with her.

She confirmed it though and then got a joking smile of her own which got him to raise an eyebrow. It wasn't that icy grin or snarl she ten [/INST] ded to sport.
What did he think he'd look like if he were normal. ""Probably at least six feet tall. Manliest beard in all the land. I remember my hair being dark brown.

Especially when they seemed like they hated each other just minutes ago. Honestly, some people just bonded over the strangest things. His head then whipped around to look at Professor Jacob when he heard his name being called. He had not known when to expect his turn, but it had to happen sometime. He calmly rose from his seat and made his way down past the students who seemed to be enjoying the show. From what had happened in the first [/INST] fight, the teachers did seem competent in keeping the students alive. With that fact in mind, he made up his mind to do his best.
He was also curious at the mention that there was a reason for the pairings chosen, and began wondering about the skill set of this 'Lain', considering his own. She turned out to be a girl he had not noticed before, and only put a face to the name when the green-haired girl, now holding a snack, offered her some words of encouragement. He nodded as a gesture of thanks to the two students who had wished the both of them luck and cheered them on before stepping into the arena. </s>"
212,"<s>[INST] Elaine raised her hand from her sit as she said ""Lady Jade, I'm not feeling so well, I'll have to leave class. I'm sorry"", after that she left the building running.
""Well... that wasn't planned."" said Lady Jade pausing for a bit.  Sarah, you'll be [/INST] Cole's adversary. Your powers aren't that similar but I'm sure it will be an interesting fight"" after she was done talking she approached the arena, press some buttons in the side of the arena and at each corner of the arena puddles of water formed. </s>"
213,"<s>[INST] Sarah heard the teacher call her name, and she panicked. How was she supposed to ... wait, what is she doing?? She sensed the water before she saw it. Of course.
Sarah let out a deep sigh and calmed herself down. She should have known the teachers would take care of this. Hadn't she just seen just how far they would go to make sure the students could fight safely and test their abilities to the fullest?
Suddenly, Sarah smiled. She'd get to test the extent of her powers without having to worry about hurting anyone. Feeling the call of the open water, she jumped up from her seat and practically bolted down to the arena. She was still vaguely aware of the water in the pipes beh [/INST] ind the walls, but the call of the open water was so much stronger! She took her place in her corner of the arena, took off her shoes stepped into one of the puddles. She laughed out loud, turned to Cole and said  ""My name is Sarah, pleased to meet you. This is going to be fun!""  Suddenly serious, Sarah turned her attention to one of the puddles. The water stirred and bubbled until it was nice and muddy. Content with the results, she smiled again, made the muddy water rise and dumped the lot of it unceremoniously on Cole, drenching him.
Giggling at the result, she waited for the muddy, sopping boy to make his first move.
(edited when I realised she actually got up twice, lol) </s>"
214,"<s>[INST] It took Cole a second to process what had just happened. Oh no she didn't... He scoffed in disgust at the sludge that covered him before shaking a few drops from the limp blond locks that hung over his eyes. He then shot a glare at the bubbly hydrokinetic, though, a light, mischievous smirk slowly crossed his face right after as a soft growl escaped his throat. His transformation was rapid and very sudden, and in the blink of an eye, the teenage boy was replaced with a creature that looked like it had walked right out of an urban legend.
The completely-transformed monster l [/INST] et out a blood-curdling shriek and charged towards Sarah on all fours at breathtaking speed. Cole was obviously still in control, and kept an ear out for any sounds of moving water around him so that he could dodge any attempted attacks from the back or sides, as well as above or below. When he was close enough, he took a giant leap, propelling himself straight at her. His jaws were wide open with razor-sharp teeth baring, threatening to rip whatever they could clamp down on to shreds. Of course, the giant claws that extended from his fingers posed just as much of a danger. </s>"
215,"<s>[INST] Sarah giggled again as she witnessed Cole go through the stages of realising and accepting what she'd done.
She saw the mischieveous smile and knew something was coming, so she braced herself.   ""What the...""   Suddenly all she could see was this enormous monster leaping at her. She didn't even have time to think about another attack, all she could think about was getting out of the way.
Without thinking about it, she reacted. In the blink of an eye, she disa [/INST] ppeared and reappeared in another spot. A deceptively small puddle of water now filled the spot her feet had just left.   ""at least he'll be clean again""     ""wait, how the hell did I do that?""   Thoughts of joy and shock flashed through her. She'd never even considered trying this before. She turned her attention back to the puddle, and sensed how deep it really was. Ready to turn the whole thing into a monster filled, wet tornado, she waited for the splash. </s>"
216,"<s>[INST] Cole landed right as Sarah vanished, skidding to a stop just as he touched the wall of the arena. Sure, going at that speed, he did expect her to drop all ideas for any offensive moves and simply focus on getting out of the way, but he did not imagine that she would literally turn into water, or at least that was what he assumed had just happened. He did not have much time to ponder over it however, for the puddle of water that one of his feet had landed in had unexpectedly turned into a whirlpool that began rapidly drawing him in.
You've got to be kidding m- He drove a set of his claws into the ground, which raked through the dirt for a second before it stopped him just in time from going right under. Using both hands, he managed to claw his way out of the spinning water. Could she really just f [/INST] orm whirlpools wherever she wanted on the field? That would not be an issue if he continued being on the move at the speed he was going, but after seeing what she could do, he decided to go about it differently.
Surely she can't make anything come out of this solid surface. He thought, as his claws made indents in the wall for him to climb clear off of the ground. He had planned to go all out with his high-speed attacks, hoping not to give her time to go offensive, but perhaps it was time to stay put to see what else she had up her sleeve, while he still could. After all, that was what she had done, and she managed to counter his attack quite cleverly. He spotted her some distance away and watched her closely as he cautiously treaded across the wall, ready to dodge whatever she would throw at him. </s>"
217,"<s>[INST] Sarah was impressed with how Cole was handeling what she was throwing at him. She watched him claw his way out of the hole, and onto the wall. She took this time to reposition herself near another puddle, a big one this time.   ""throwing""   Sarah suddenly knew what to do. As Cole walked across the wall, Sarah raised the whirlpool of water above the pool and concentrated it into a beam of water. For good measure, she added the muddy water she had dumped on him earlier to the beam. She took a moment to gauge his speed.   ""He [/INST] 's fast""   flashed through her mind. She divided the enormous beam of water into smaller beams, and shot them in Cole's direction at high speed. She made sure to aim not only at Cole, but also behind and in front of him. Sarah was hoping to hit him, and maybe knock him off the wall, with at least one shot.
At the same time she concentrated, ready to regroup the rest of the water into the big puddle close to her feet. She was sure she'd need something to shield herself with.

218,"<s>[INST] Eira blanked for a moment when one of the contestants got changed up. Sarah was her name, and apparently water was her friend. Eira laughed, in a sarcastic way. Her smile was simply blood curdling. ""Damn, I wish that I had gotten to go against her. She wouldn't have lasted half a se [/INST] cond.""
She watched as the boy, Cole, changed. Damn, he was fast. Definitely faster than Kaze. However, Eira guessed that he had a lower body temperature, which would make him more susceptible to her flames. Either way, Eira wuld have wiped the field with either of these contestants. </s>"
219,"<s>[INST] Cole saw the water rising, and imagined that she intended to have the entire column of liquid slam into him. Well, he turned out to be partly right. The large stream splitting into smaller streams came as a little surprise, but he was confident in managing it without much of a problem. He sprang into action, bounding across the wall as he swiftly dodged the smaller jets of water.
However, one in particular landed slightly too close for comfort, interrupting his concentration. He lost his grip on the wall, but landed expertl [/INST] y on all fours as another jet headed straight towards him. Using his tapered claws, he diverted most of it to shoot to either side of him, greatly reducing its impact. Considering the fact that he was back on the ground, he was almost immediately on the move again at top speed.
Seeing that Sarah was concentrating on a nearby puddle, he made his way around the arena and charged straight at her from the back with a claw raised, intending to deliver a strike before she could turn liquid again, or establish any form of defence. </s>"
220,"<s>[INST] Kaze just pet Eira on the head with a couple fingers. Each touch was announced with a soft hiss from the cold meeting the heat. ""Now now, it's not a competition."" He said before giving her a grin. ""Besides, you can freeze the water...but it's still water. Just solid. So you'd give her cudgels instead of whips."" He stated, attempting to dampen the girls ego. ""The boy could probably [/INST] move faster than you can react aside from just coating the area in your icy fire. I got through and I'm slower."" He continued on while he watched the water bender and beast boy fight it out. Neither one of them really landing a hit yet.
Then again it wasn't until the end of their fight that Eira and himself actually touched each other. But they had both probably been holding back. </s>"
221,"<s>[INST] Lucky's eyes followed Lain as the nervous girl ran away from the confrontation. She wasn't surprised, however, she was rather disappointed instead. Lucky understood not wanting to use your powers, especially not in a setting like this.  ]  She thought to herself as the battle between Cole and Sarah sprang into action quickly. Sarah had initiated the combat with a cheeky move.
""Shit!"" Lucky cussed when she realized she didn't have her phone [/INST] recording and hit play just after Cole began his first charge at Sarah. She set it up hurriedly and then glanced back at Eric. ""How do you think these two will do?"" She asked. She took a handful of trail-mix and unceremoniously crammed all of it into her mouth at once. Her cheeks puffed out to the sides like a squirrel's might while she munched on it happily, and she shook the bag in Eric's direction so he could take more if he wanted to. </s>"
222,"<s>[INST] The other girl Elaine ran away, Eric watched as she left the arena, but as the teachers called the other girl down. Eric's attention turned away from Elaine to Sarah, he was pumped to watch this fight. ""Good Luck!"" He shouted after her as she made her way down. But on the inside he was wondering how she was going to do, these fights had been made with certain pairs in mind and now this was a random variable, but he shrugged and sat back.
As the fighters introduced himself he noted Sarah's ability to control water as they had the arena form small puddles of water. She dumped some muddy water on her opponent which solicited a laugh from him. But then as they started their fight, he saw the full extent of Cole's abilities. And then they went at it, the fight was intense and as he watched he felt less and less sure about himse [/INST] lf and his ability to fit in here. He couldn't do anything, he would probably flunk out. Maybe even get kicked out, who knows he certainly didn't. This showed plainly on his face, and on the way he was grasping the bench his knuckles white, his usual smile a frown of concern. ""I'm not going to make it here."" He said in a hushed whisper, he took his eyes off the fight and down to his feet. Staring into space.
It was Lucky who brought him back, it was an innocent question about the fight. ""What? Oh, I think both of them are great fighters. It's probably going to be really close."" He said, his voice sounded nervous but he forced a smile on his face, but refused Lucky's offer of a snack. He looked over at her and thought about what she could do, he wondered if he would last five seconds against her if they fought in the arena. </s>"
223,"<s>[INST] Cole did exactly what Sarah had expected, he tried to use his speed and agility to avoid the jets of water. He actually managed to dodge quite a few of them before one of them forced him to leave the wall.
She was impressed by the way he managed to claw his way through the water, and saw him coming at her again, trying to attack her from behind.
Instantly, she raised the contents of the huge puddle at her feet. She made no attempt to attack Cole with it, but surrounded herself with it instead. The water formed a bubble around Sarah. In order to keep it together, she made it flow around her in strong, sol [/INST] id circles.
Cole's claw attack hit her, but not with the force he intended. However, because of the rapidly moving currents in the bubble of water, Sarah felt the nails run all the way across her back, leaving a diagonal pattern reaching from her right shoulder to just above her left hip.
 ""Let's not do that again""  and  ""That was my favourite shirt""  flashed through Sarah's mind. She traded places with Cole, who was now stuck inside her bubble of water. Wincing at the stinging on her back, Sarah used the water from a small puddle nearby to cool her wounds. Then she prepared herself for Cole's next move. </s>"
224,"<s>[INST] As Kaze patted her head, Eira snapped at him. A snarl was on her face as she spoke. ""It is always a competition. WHether it's here or on the streets of New York, it is always a competition."" Turning back to the fight, Eira watched as the boy, Cole, got knocked from the wall. ""I know that he's fast, but his body temperature has to be that of a normal human, which would mean that one touch of my flames and he'd be down for the count."" Breathing deeply, something clicked in her mind.
All of a sudden, an image of Kaze as he would have looked if he was human. A tall, fair-sk [/INST] inned man with long brown hair and rough stubble flooded her mind. He was still wearing the skirt around his muscular hips. His muscles were defined and easily noticeable. Eira's mouth, against her wishes, began to drool. Scowling in response, the girl snarled at Kaze, a thick blush coming up on her own pale skin.
""Damnit Kaze. You have no idea how much I can actually do. We didn't know that we could go all out. As such, I think you were holding back, same as what I was doing. "" Hoping to change her thoughts, Eira was battling with herself, and she was losing miserably. </s>"
225,"<s>[INST] Sarah's water shield did not surprise Cole as much as the trap that followed. Finding himself suddenly immersed in water, he immediately dug the claws of one hand into the ground to anchor himself, while using those of the other to slice through the strong flow of water that circled around him. Jets of water shot out in several directions as he broke through the surface, though, it took a few more seconds for him to completely tear himself out of the water sphere. He then quickly latched back onto the wall in time to catch Sarah tending to the injury he had inflicted [/INST] on her.
Seeing her bleed was strangely... satisfying. He wanted to do it again, to cut her more, to draw more of that blood from her flesh, which he simply wished to rip- No! What are you thinking?! Get a grip! His rational thinking kicked in, letting him focus once again. How long had it been since the start of the battle? He could feel the savage instinct that would always come with his beast form start to creep in. That was not good. Consciously suppressing it, he crept over to her slowly, intending to quickly strike again the moment she attempted something else. </s>"
226,"<s>[INST] Kaze just shook his head. ""It's not always a competition. We're supposed to be learning, either how to control or better use out powers."" He said, now getting some backstory on the girl. She was from New York and the streets...well that could mean anything. Was she disowned? Run away? Just thrown out? She'd let him know when she was ready and wanting to. ""Also body temperature rises with work. Aside from insulated clothing people sweat in the middle of winter."" He continued on while relaxing and watching the fight.
His ears swiveled when he heard the sound of water not in the ring. Looking to her [/INST] he noticed she was drooling which got a loud laugh from him. Her ferocity was a little ruined by that face engulfing blush she was sporting. He had a major shit eating grin on his face even while she talked at him. ""I knew we could go all out. I didn't want to tire the teacher out by destroying the arena."" He said before letting that grin fade. ""I've never really tested my strength, the most I've done is throw a car but even that felt light."" He said. He had made the ground in the arena tremble by hitting it, he was obviously a powerhouse and was holding back for fear of causing too much damage. </s>"
227,"<s>[INST] Sarah was beginning to get pissed. She was hurting and getting tired. And that bloody mutt didn't have a scratch on him. There he was, back on the bloody wall!
Splitting the water in the massive bubble, Sarah shoved half of it back towards the ground near the wall. The water seemed to disappear into the ground, which now looked as dry as before. Underneeth the now thin layer of dirt and dry sand, a pool of quicksand was for [/INST] ming. Sarah watched Cole for a second and realised he seemed distracted. She shot a quick jet of water towards him, and knocked him off the wall, straight into the quicksand. Cole seemed to be sucked in.  let's see him claw his way out of this one  she thought to herself, as she added more water to the bubble she was still holding afloat behind her, and deepened the pool of quicksand for good measure.
(edited for continuity) </s>"
228,"<s>[INST] Sarah's next move confused Cole. What was the point of shooting water into the ground right below him? He expected something to pop out of that very spot, and he readied himself for whatever it might be. However, while concentrating on that area, he was completely caught off guard by a jet of water that came at him from another direction, causing him to plummet into the point of interest which he immediately realized was what could be compared to quicksand. The ground was quickly dragging him under, and he had to do something, fast. His claws managed to grab hold of some solid earth, which he assumed was the side of the pit, just as his head disappeared below the sandy surface. He had stopped sinking, but the pulling force of the quicksand was much too strong for him to simply climb out of it.
The entire experience was nerve-racking. Cole tried to remain calm and think of a way out, though, it was not easy. He was about to suffocate, and the monster in his head was figh [/INST] ting for control. He had been under all that sand for some time. Were the teachers not supposed to intervene? Perhaps they were expecting him to be able to do something about his current situation. There was no doubt that he actually could, but that would mean... Were they really planning to drive him to that point? He realized that he did not have a choice. He was trapped, and there was no other way. Fine, just for this one time, save me...
The creature suddenly tore out of the sand as if a rush of adrenaline had been gained. It skidded across the ground to a stop and let out a savage, animalistic shriek before making a headlong charge at the driving force behind all the water-based attacks and traps. It moved just as quickly as before, but this time, in a significantly more wild and frenzied manner. Now mostly driven by bloodlust, it had the full intention to tear the girl to shreds. It was obvious that 'Cole' was no longer all there, if he was still even there at all. </s>"
229,"<s>[INST] The moment the beast show signs to be in control the teachers were ready. Professor Jacob was ready, in a blink of an eye the no longer was watching the fight, the had Cole restrained from the back holding his arms behind it's back. ""Control it, restrain it's hold on you, your are the beast you have control over it, you and the beast are [/INST] one, and it does not matter if you THINK you cannot control him past 10 minutes. Try it and push it back to it's hole."" 
At the same time Jacob moved, Lady Jade froze the water, not ice frozen, it was still liquid, but it didn't move. ""It's over water girl, release the water and leave the arena. Now Cole has to fight himself."" 
Mentions: </s>"
230,"<s>[INST] holy shit what just happened?
During the battle, Sarah had never doubted that Cole had been in control, even in his altered form. It was obvious that this was no longer the case. The teacher's words rang in her mind. Had it really only been 10 minutes? Sarah was scared, hurt and tired, but su [/INST] ddenly she was rooting for Cole.
She headed for the edge of the arena quickly, ready to join the others. Before she exited, she looked back and said ""come on Cole, don't give up now. You've got this, buddy."" Without checking if he'd heard her, she sat down near the others and closed her eyes. </s>"
231,"<s>[INST] Something had taken hold of the beast, stopping him before he caused any severe damage. He struggled to break free, switching his focus to the one responsible and desiring for nothing more than to bite the teacher's head clean off his shoulders. However, Professor Jacob held strong, and... was he speaking to him? Whatever little that was left of Cole's consciousness managed to comprehend some of his words.
""You are the beast you have control over it, you and the beast are one.""
You don't- you don't understand... I want to... I need to kill you, but... it's not me. It never was me... it can't be...
There was then another voice, which called him by name. ""Come on Cole, don't give up now. You've got this, buddy.""
Was it really all on him? That was what scared him. It seemed easy to hold the savagery of the monster accountable every time he was not in control. It had helped him cope with what he had done the first time he had discovered his abilities and shifted unintentionally. It was not him who did it, he could not control it when the urge was too strong, that was what he had kept telling himself. Even now, as the beast continued to lash out, he wished th [/INST] at Professor Jacob would simply hit him in the head so that he could avoid all this, but the teacher was not allowing that.
With the beast still mostly in control, even that little bit of rationalizing was draining him mentally. He could not keep this up much longer. He had to focus on regaining control. He was afraid of what the outcome might imply, but he had to accept that it could be done, at least for the time being. Part of him did not want to try, but he had to, he needed answers!
I'm in control... I don't need you, not anymore. I'm not letting you hurt anyone. Get out... get out of my head!
It took all of his willpower and concentration to toss the beast out, which allowed him to eventually shift back into his human form. The boy went limp in the teacher's grip, panting from both physical and mental exhaustion. He was shaking slightly from the trauma, and it took a moment for him to calm himself down.
""What are you saying, Sir?"" He muttered in between deep breaths. ""What does this all mean? It couldn't have been me. H-How is this possible? Does this mean that the whole time, I could have... No... I don't even remember much of what it had done..."" </s>"
232,"<s>[INST] As the boy went back to his human form and lost his strength Jacob lifted him up and held him with both arms speaking softly to him. ""It is normal to loose control when we have our first power surges, when it first happened to me I passed out exhausted before I could slow down. And the best wait to start getting grip of our powers is pushing ourselves out of our comfort zone.""  He continued now addressing to the whole class, ""And that's our objective in this first class, we want you to push yourselves, to leave your comfort zone and to improve. The best way to control your powers is to understand how they work and wha [/INST] t limits you can reach and break.""
With a smile in his face he left the arena still holding Cole, ""So little one, do you want me to take you to your room to rest or do you want to watch the rest of the fights?""
When Jacob left the arena with Cole Lady Jade addressed the class. ""As everyone could see once again, we want you to push your limits with no worries of harming or getting harmed, next duo can enter the arena, Luxianne and Eric."" She walked towards the control panel of the arena, pushed a few buttons and the water dried out at the same time the ceiling was opening letting in the sun rays from outside.

233,"<s>[INST] Eira was shaking. She was shaking bad. The girl hadn't known that she could go full out, but now she does. A feral grin was plastered to her face as her wild, brown eyes scanned the field. That last fight, between beasty and aqua, was exhilirating. Damnit, why couldn't she go up again.
Eira's flames were sharp, jagged spears that danced around her form as she gripped the railing in front of her. The metal slowly froze in her grip, eventually shattering from the extreme cold. A he [/INST] avy mist escaped her lips as she exhaled.
""Hey, Kaze,"" Her twisted voice, darker than anything the dragon could remember hearing, came out of her throat. ""Wanna have a rematch?"" Her feral, wild eyes turned towards Kaze. Eira's snow white hair flowed down her face as her head tilted backwards. Her black flames, exuding cold and darkness alike, danced around her in a bloodthirsty frenzy. If there was anyone who embodied the arctic in the dead of its eternal night, then it was Eira. </s>"
234,"<s>[INST] Kaze watched how Eira seemed to change during the fights, shaking first, then her powers getting a little more out of control. He was naturally wary of her at this point, mostly because she held his weakness. But also because she seemed to be a little insane. Why are the cute ones always crazy? He thought grumpily before she shattered the metal in her frigid grasp. When she turned to look at him he was surprised she said his name, she had continued to call him Scales even after they fought.
He turned his full attention to her. ""We're here to learn to control ourselves, Eira."" He stated, his voice firm. ""I don't know if the even [/INST] Lady Jade can bring back the dead with her time abilities. That's why I hold back, and didn't fight you to my fullest."" He said before shaking his head. ""Seriously, it didn't take much strength to make the ground tremble when I tripped you up."" Kaze explained, letting her know the seriousness of what she seemed to want.
When Kaze had first gotten to the school he had no limiters set and he had broken many things. Learning control had allowed him some semblance of normalcy despite his appearance. He'd want the teachers and the principals permission to go all out before even really thinking seriously about letting the control go. </s>"
235,"<s>[INST] Eric watched the two combatants go back and forth, the fight was intense. Sarah seemed to have the upper hand with her water powers, making traps for Cole. She was certainly clever about how she was fighting, she managed to trap him in quicksand. But that managed to be quite the mistake, that's when things went crazy Cole seemed to lose control. The teachers intervened, and Sarah returned to her seat.
""Hey you did a good job. Just don't bea [/INST] t yourself up."" He said, and nodded to the teachers telling him to come down to the arena. His heart sounded like a drum, and it seemed to get louder as he took step after step.
It felt like a lifetime for him to reach the grounds itself, as he stood he nodded to Cole still being propped up by the teacher. ""Dude that was awesome, good job controlling it."" He gave a small smile, and a thumbs up. Before taking his position, waiting for Lucky. </s>"

Sarah got up and walked to the edge of the arena. She couldn't help it. ""he'll be okay, right?"" She whispered to Lady Jade. </s>"
237,"<s>[INST] Lucky had watched the fight between Sarah and Cole with baited breath. The moments that Cole was trapped in the quicksand felt like an eternity, and when he finally emerged as a bloodlust-induced monster, Lucky knew her suspicions from earlier on were correct. She would figure out what the thing sharing his body was. She couldn't believe that it was just him losing control. And if it was, that was honestly more frightening.
When the teachers intervened, she finally remembered to breathe. She looked down at her hands, which were balled into tight fists and shaking slightly with adrenaline. She clasped her hands together to stop the shaking and took a deep, long breath to steady herself. She wasn't afraid of the oncoming duel, but her body was hyping itself up for the battle witho [/INST] ut her consent.
She looked up when she and Eric were announced for the next duel. Blessed sunlight filled the arena and her hair and eyes began to glow much brighter. The light was being greedily sucked into her body, fueling her powers and causing her body to vibrate with the influx of energy. She wasted no time in taking her place opposite of Eric in the middle of the arena. She tapped her foot in time with the music now blaring from the headphones hanging around her neck. Her hair began to react as if on instinct, growing out until it flared behind her in separate, seemingly sentient sections that were ready to lash out at any potential threat. At this point, Lucky closely resembled a kumiho from Korean mythology.
""Go easy on me buddy."" Lucky said to Eric with a fierce smile. </s>"
238,"<s>[INST] It is normal to lose control... Cole repeated in a thoughtful manner, but then continued rather bitterly. ""Though, not so much to murder a couple of people while doing so, is it?""
He said nothing else as Professor Jacob helped him out of the arena, barely catching the names of the two students who were up next. One of them, the boy whom Cole assumed was 'Eric', then passed them as he made his way down. Cole managed a ""Thank you,"" in response to his encouraging words, though, he could not help but be troubled by what was on his mind.
He was then given a choice by the teacher to either stay or withdraw to his room. His memories of that fateful night were coming back to him due to the earlier ordeal, and he knew that he would not rest, but instead continue to brood about what had taken place [/INST] then, if he was alone in his room. If he stayed, there were at least things happening that could distract him from such thoughts. Furthermore, passively spectating while the other students sparred would probably be a good way to relax his mind.
He turned to the older blond. ""There's no need to trouble yourself, Sir. I can rest well out here. Thank you very much, for everything.""
Cole took hold of the nearest seat and settled into it. While the next pair of students took their places in the arena, he spotted Sarah speaking to Lady Jade. She had been a formidable opponent, from what he could remember, anyway. When given the chance, he had to thank her too, for the fight, as well as for her understanding and support, for that other voice he had heard while he was still a monster had been hers. </s>"

240,"<s>[INST] Elliot Forrester
In all of his thirteen years, Elliot had only travelled outside of Olivine City once and that was to Goldenrod City. His mum took him for a few days when he was ten and he loved every minute of it. Elliot had never been so happy when he received the letter off Professor Juniper, his Mum on the other hand didn't want him to leave thinking he was too young to travel on his own. But she couldn't convince him otherwise, his mind was set on becoming a Pokemon trainer.
Elliot had been sat at the train station for around half an hour on his own rummaging through his bag, making sure he had remembered everything. But the only thing he really needed was the train ticket, which he hadn't let go of for the past two hours. As the train pulled up to the station, [/INST] Elliot moved to the edge of the platform with a big grin on his face.
He jumped on the train as soon as the doors opened, not being able to control yourself. He'd never felt so adventurous in his whole entire life. Every minute Elliot ended up wandering around the train not being able to keep himself still. The first stop on the train journey was Ecruteak City, he read that there was two towers here and that some people believed legendary Pokemon lived there. Quite a lot of people got on the train as Elliot moved around exploring, he noticed someone only a few years older than him had got on the train on his own as well. Elliot was too scared to say anything to him anyway and decided to keep wandering about. Later on when Elliot passed the teen again, he was asleep. </s>"

 It's a big world outside 

Maria's departure was bittersweet to her. Not because she had never traveled before. She had been around Kanto and to many of the other regions with her grandfather for short trips. But on those, she knew she wouldn't be gone for long, that she would return to her home soon. But now she was off on not a trip, but an actual journey. She had no idea when she would see home again. She had no idea whether she would even do good on her journey. But she had faith in herself. Her life was going to change when she stepped in New Bark town, and even if the path she was going to take wouldn't take her to the future she saw for herself, she would still go out and face it.
""I've been on this boat for too long..."" Maria sighed as she leaned against the railing as she tried to get the ""uncertain future"" thoughts out of her head. Hailing from the region right next to Johto, but being closer to the ocean rather than the metro, Maria ended up getting a boat ticket to New Bark town, and thus, had a longer journey than most. It was already the second day that she was on the boat, but thankfully she was almost to her destination. The trip hadn't been bad, maybe a tad bit boring but not bad. Her favorite part had been seeing the Seafoam Islands and Cinnabar Island as the ship passed them. Maria got quite a few shots of them, many of them pretty good. She had ju [/INST] st finished looking at the ones she decided to keep after she uploaded them to her laptop. She had brought her laptop, camera, the few essential supplies that most trainers carried in their bags...and some pokecandy from the Safari zone. She knew exactly what starter she was getting and while she knew Hoppip would be good for some aerial shots, a Hoppip wouldn't be much good when it came to actually battling, at least not at first. Her only hope was that she could get a decent battling pokemon before she ran out of candy or angered one too much with a rock.
But those concerns were at the back of her mind as the ship finally made dock. Maria was one of the first off the ship and looking around at the tiny town. Maria could even feel the winds of her new beginning blowing around her...until she realized that it was actually a helicopter letting some people off. Was that one of the other trainers...she felt like she had seen one of those people before but she couldn't place it. Aw well, it didn't matter to her right now. Her first order of business was simple. She asked a local to take a picture of her next to the town's sign. Her first photo in Johto, the first of many, and she wanted it to be of that so she could send it back to her grandfather.
With that done, Maria quickly made her way to Juniper's lab (after asking for directions), ready to meet her first partner in her journey. </s>"

The last thirty minutes of the journey, Elliot managed to sit down, but couldn't keep himself from fidgeting. His foot was shaking from side to side and he patted his leg with his hand as he looked out the window. The nerves started to set in for Elliot as the train journey kept on going. All the things that could go wrong, he was slightly second guessing his decision to actually come. But no, he couldn't think like that, he had to think positive. To show that he can be a one of the greatest Pokemon trainers in the world.
As the train pulled up to the station at New Bark Town, Elliot started to grin, the nerves slowly started to vanish. He waited a few seconds before standing up and getting off the train. The few people to get off the train were already rushin [/INST] g off going about their own business as Elliot stepped onto the station. Elliot waited a minute and grabbed his woolly bobble hat from his bag and then wandered off to look for the Pokemon Lab. It only took a minute for Elliot to spot it though, it wasn't really hard though, It was massive compared to every other building in the town.
Elliot stared at the big doors for a minute taking a few deep breaths. One step at a time, Elliot thought to himself as he entered the Lab. The Lab was like nothing he'd ever seen, except for something on TV. Elliot slowly looked around with his mouth wide open. As Elliot marvelled at the place, he didn't really notice two people watching him. When he finally did notice them, he stopped in his tracks, ""Hi... I'm... I'm Elliot... Elliot Forrester."" </s>"

 The Lab 

It didn't take too long to find Professor Juniper's lab. Even if she hadn't gotten directions, Maria probably would have been able to pick it out of all the other buildings thanks to the fact it looked like what you would expect a Pokemon lab to look like. Bigger than the rest of the buildings and had a more important feel to it, or maybe that was because it was more importance to her than all the other buildings in the town. Either way, this was Maria's destination and it was time to go in and finally meet the kind professor who was giving her this wonderful opportunity. So she grabbed the doorknob and turned it, opening the door and stepping in.
""Hello, I'm here!"" Maria said with a smile as she stepped into the lab. An assistant came up to her and told her everyone else was already in the back. Oh dear! Was she late? Maria quickly made her way to the back of the lab where there indeed was others. It looked like there was three (four?) other trainers, as well as Professor Juniper waiting t [/INST] here. Maria wasn't sure how many people had been accepted into the program, she thought it had to be more than four or five people, though, so that meant she hadn't kept everyone waiting. In fact, it seemed like they were all introducing themselves. ""Hello there Professor Juniper, other soon to be trainers. I'm Maria Conway and I-"" Maria stopped as her eyes fell onto Briar. ""Oh my gosh!"" She said as she went over to them, a little excited. ""It's a Moltres xa20!"" She said a she looked over the camera Briar was holding. ""That's a really good one! I didn't think there was going to be anybody like me here. Though I guess you're into cinematography than photography."" Well...they actually looked more like they expected to be in front of the camera. But they were the one holding the camera.
""You'll have to share your footage with me sometime! But for now..."" Maria turned back to Professor Juniper and got out the picture of the Hoppip that she had sent to her. ""I'd really like to see if the little guy matches the picture!"" </s>"
244,"<s>[INST] The energy this young crowd brought into the lab was almost overwhelming. It was a nice change of pace as things had started to become rather monotonous. “Now, now. I’m sure you’re all eager to get started on your journey, so I won’t keep you waiting much longer,” the professor said. Looking back towards one of her associates and signaling him to come forth, the lanky assistant brought a tray out with multi [/INST] ple Pokeballs in it. “Go ahead and choose one that’s to your liking,” the professor explained. “On your way out, be sure to pick up a Pokedex as well! That’s what you’ll be using as your all access pass to Pokecenters and Pokemarts around the region!” Scanning over the crowd one last time, she took a deep breath in flashed them all a smile. “Now shoo! Hurry on! These Pokemon arent gonna train their selves!” </s>"

261,"<s>[INST] Welcome, young pirate, to the world of One Piece!

If you even find yourself in the famous city of Loguetown, make sure you take a moment to watch the sun rise. People the world over swear that it's the best view you'll ever get of a sunrise in the East Blue. You peer out with watchful eyes as the wee hours of the morning pass you by. The darkness slowly turns to red and orange. The clouds light up. And then the sun rises over the horizon, spilling it's colours across the ocean like a cracked egg. And as it bathes the entire city in it's warm glow, a feeling of promise and new beginnings seems to soak into your bones.
It is for this very reason that the town recieves such a high amount of visitors. There's something about it that really gets into peoples heads. It give them that push to try something new. Many believe the place to be lucky, and like to visit before making a big change. The people lovingly refer to it as the city of beginnings. And for pirates the name is even more fitting. For a pirate, Loguetown was much more than just a nice view and pleasant superstition. It's practically sacred. It [/INST] is the holy ground upon which the Pirate King was executed. The very place where the golden age of piracy began. The very air is thick with history. All the magnificent famous pirates that aspiring newbies look up to? They all visited this place too. They stood here, breathing in the same air, watching the same sun. For a pirate, there was no better place to begin your journey.
And so, as the sun rose on another beautiful day in Loguetown, many aspiring young pirates were undoubtedly staring down the barrel of their futures' gun with promise twinkling in their eyes. Even if they hadn't watched the sunrise, they would be feeling this excitement. It was in the air, and it was infectious. Because the day had finally come. The day they were waiting for. The day they had picked to become a pirate. The day it was all going to begin.
OOC: Write up a quick post and don't forget to mention where you are and what you're doing. It doesn't matter if you're scattered around the city or located in the same place; whatever floats your boat. You can do whatever you want. I'll start our little game in a while. Good luck! </s>"
262,"<s>[INST] Eyes closed to the world, Claribel flinched as a beam of sunlight weaved through the building tops and chimneys to smack her in the face. ""Hnn?"" she groaned as she lifted her head, blinking her blue eyes. Parting her long pink hair, it didn't do much to block the sunlight.
Still not quite awake, Claribel dropped her head back down, thumping it against the wood, before letting herself stay adrift in that half awake state as the sun climbed a bit more. After a few minutes, a voice called out, ""Claribel? What are you doing here?""
Lifting her head off the door to her workplace, Claribel stumbled a step away, before yawning, ""W-work.""
Her mustachioed employer moved to unlock the door, noting, ""You're off today, aren't you?""
Eyes snapping open, Claribel gasped, ""Eh!? No way!"" Pouting a bit, she admitted, ""I-I forgot...""
""Well, that's normal, at least for you. Still, I can't complain: at least you're forgetting you don't need to come to work instead of the other way around,"" the boss said, moving into the store.
Claribel followed, habitually raising the blinds over the window, which was plastered with posters advertising some music groups: largely local, but plenty that had gotten East Blue or worldwide renown. Looking around, she sa [/INST] w the walls covered with hooks, many dangling sets of headset TDs, labeled with prices, a good number of them empty and in need of restocking. There were also a few shelves and ground space dedicated to bigger ones and other music players. While the boss went to the back room, Claribel yelled, ""I don't want to go home so I'm going to borrow one!""
""Again? At least write down which one you took, so... Actually, we got a new shipment last night."" A few moments later, the boss came out with a yellow and silver TD headset. Tossing it, Claribel caught it as he suggested, ""New 'Shin Grasp'. You're good at making recommendations, so give it a listen before you come in tomorrow.""
Throwing it over her ears with a smile, Claribel giggled, ""Got it!"" A bounce in her step, she bolted out the door, out into the town. As she stepped out, she raised her hand, about to start the music, but something came into her head...
She'd forgotten to go to work before, but now she was forgetting not to? Why was that? Did it have to do with the reasons she came her in the first place? This was the one and only Loguetown after all.
Just as she had begun to dwell on it, her finger tapped the button on her TD, music blasting away her worries in the dawnlight. </s>"
263,"<s>[INST] Even as the sun heralded the arrival of a new day, in some places, the work of the night remained unfinished....
The thuggish-looking man slammed his hand down on the desk, his sizeable nose ring shaking as he did so. He stared daggers at the terrified old man before him with a mocking grin on his face. His equally barbaric cohorts behind him laughed at the elderly storeowner's yelp in reply.
""Come on, Gramps, you know how this game is played..."" Nose Ring said with a hiss. ""You get a loan from the Spice Boys, the Spice Boys expect to be paid back. How can you call yourself a reputable business if you don't hold up your end of the bargain?...""
The old man stammered as he mustered up enough courage to speak back. ""B-But....This interest you're talking about is unreasonable! I-I asked for sixty-thousand Beli and you expect me to pay you back six hundred-thou-""
Nose Ring slammed his hand on the desk again to silence the old man. ""Your own fault for taking the deal, old-timer! And we both know you can't reveal to the Marines that you've been dealing with street gangs. Now...I've lost my patience. You can either give us what we're owed, or our muscle is going to have a more personal chat with you.....""
The shopkeeper's eyes fearfully shifted to the figure standing off to the side, behind Nose Ring. A gaunt-looking shape of a man, concealed by a thick cloak, the long hilt of a massive sword held haphazardly in one of his hands as the blade dragged on the ground. From beneath the cloak, the figure made guttural, growling sounds, like a beast.....
""...B-But....I...I-I can't.....""
Nose Ring let out a malicious chuckle. ""Wrong answer."" He took a few steps back, and folded his arms. ""Take care of him, Scab.""
The old man fearfully fell from his chair and backed against the wall, panicking.
""No! No, please!""
.......
The figure didn't move.
There was a silence in the room, as Nose Ring repeated his order.
"".....Take CARE of him, Scab.""
.....
The figure didn't move.
""Scab.""
No movement.
""SCAB!!""
Nada.
""Scab, WHAT are you doing!?"" Nose Ring angrily said as he turned and grabbed at the figure's cloak, yanking it off.
Perhaps it would have been better had the cloak stayed on, as the sight without it was worse: Hideously burnt, scarred flesh, haphazardly stitched together in a shoddy attempt at reconstruction. A dirty, frayed-looking black jacket and a hair of wild-unkempt, equally black hair. He looked more like a zombie out of a horror story than a man; a truly terrifying sight.
...Or, it would be, if he were not so clearly fast asleep on his feet, the guttural noises from before being his snores.
""...Zzzzzzzzz.........""
An awkward silence filled the room for a moment, before Nose Ring began slapping his slumbering ""muscle.""
""HOW THE HELL ARE YOU ASLEEP!?"" He shouted petulantly, aggressively rousing the scorched young man from his slumber. He looked at Nose Ring through bleary eyes, blinking a few times before tenderly rubbing his scarred face.
""...Hahh....Hey, sorry, man...."" The young man spoke with a quiet, gentle voice and a yawn, ""Didn't get much sleep tonight, too itchy....mu [/INST] sta dozed off. My bad...""
""We're WORKING here, Scab!"" Nose Ring shouted, ""What kind of mercenary takes a nap in the middle of a JOB!?""
""...Hey, man, look,"" Scab replied lazily, punctuated by another yawn. ""I told you, the name's Scabbard....Scab-bard...Like on a sword, y'know? Scab's like....a way grosser name.""
""I don't care what your name is!!"" Nose Ring said as he rubbed his temples in exasperation. ""Just go do your job and thrash the old man!""
Scabbard stared blankly at Nose Ring before looking over at the cowering shopkeeper. He walked closer to him, one hand in a pocket, the other loudly dragging his huge sword behind him. He stared, curiously, before looking back at Nose Ring and pointing to the shopkeep.
""...This old dude?""
""Yes.""
""....What'd he do again?""
""HE OWES US MONEY!""
""Oh! Right, right, alright....."" Scabbard looked back at the terrified (and now mildly confused) shopkeeper as he walked up to him, causing him to flinch in terror. Scabbard crouched down to eye level with the old man, and gave him a dig in the shoulder.
""..Uhh....Take that."" He said in half-hearted triumph.
Nose Ring stared at Scab in disbelief as he rose back to his feet. "".....What the hell was that!?""
""...Uh..I hit him!""
""That was BARELY A HIT! Use your god damn sword, maybe!?""
Scab looked down groggily at the massive thing. ""...What, this? Dude, I'm not gonna hit the old-timer with this...He's like...old and shit. He'd get squished...""
""So CUT HIM with it!""
""...Ah, no, I can't do that. S'not sharp.""
""It's in its sheathe! Take it out!""
""...Oh, uh...I can't do that. S'locked up, and I don't got the key.""
"".......""
""....Maybe I could knock a chair over?""
Nose Ring looked like he was ready to blow a gasket. And then proceeded to blow a gasket.
""THAT'S IT! You're off! Get the hell out, and you can forget about your pay!""
""Hey, hold on, like, maybe I could....""
""OUT!""
Scabbard was collectively shoved out of the store and into the alley outside by Nose Ring and his remaining compatriots, the door behind him slamming shut. He blinked a few times, staring at the door while processing what just happened, then sighed heavily as it clicked in his head. This was the third time in a month he'd been kicked off of a job he'd been hired to do, by three different gangs, no less. At this rate, his rep would render him unemployable. He scratched his arm in quiet annoyance. Stressful thinking always irritated his skin....actually, a lot of things irritated his skin. Pretty much everything irritated his dry, itchy, burned skin. God, the thing's he'd do for a bottle of lotion right about now, or a dip in a hot spring.....
As his mind sleepily wandered, his eyes got an unexpected hit of sunlight, and he wince. Shielding his eyes, he looked up at the warmly orange sky from the dingey alleyway. The sun was finally up, it was a new day.
With another yawn, Scabbard walked out of the alleyway into the busy streets of Lougetown, his sword rested on his shoulders. The back-alley crook life was starting to become unviable. Maybe it was time to start thinking about the future more, to start figuring things out... </s>"
264,"<s>[INST] The fisherman gave another tug, and hauled the net up out of the ocean as the sea salt stung his eyes. Wiping the tears away with one sun-browned hand, he gave a glance back towards the shoreline, now only a hop-skip-and-a-jump away. The trawler had been out all night, and had come back with a nice haul. Now he could finally head home, get a nice shower, a hot meal, and some much needed rest.
""HEEEEEEY MIIIIIISTEEEEEER!!""
He turned; was someone calling to him? Who could it be, out here on the water at such an early hour? Another night-fisher coming in?
No. It was a boy, in a dinghy. A...very fast dinghy. A very fast dinghy that was approaching more and more quickly, even though the boy had no oars, and in fact was clinging to the boat and leaning back, his legs rigid in front of him like a toboggan rider who was trying desperately to put his heels into the snow. A nervous smile plastered his face.
""DO YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE REVERSE THRUST?""
""Reverse what?!"" the man shouted, just before he ducked under the awning near his ship's cabin. The dinghy shot by like a bullet, the young man's screams doppler-ing into the distance. The fisherman could have sword he saw a...large hole of some kind, spewing rocket fire, coming right out of the youth's back!
""ME NEEEEEEEEEIIIIIIITHEEEEEEEEERRR!!""
And so Zehst Messerschmitt came to Loguetown, though not at all in the fashion one might have imagined. The rocket propelled dinghy hit the sand and kept going, its hull shedding timbers as it ramped up off a dune and sailed into the air. Zehst looked around in awe at all the houses--the villages back on the Gecko Islands hadn't been near this big--then remem [/INST] bered he was falling out of the sky at something like a hundred and twenty miles an hour.
He'd finally figured out how to make the rockets come out wherever and whenever he wanted. Now he had to figure out how to put on the brakes. He supposed he could always just...turn them off?
Of course, by the time he came to this conclusion--having crossed his legs and put one hand on his chin, nodding sagely--he had already plowed through a line of laundry, an extremely alarmed cat, and some poor old man's cabbage cart. With bits of vegetable and an angry cat clinging to his face, he looked up with a grin and snapped his fingers. The rocket was sucked back into his flesh with a ""shwoop"" sound, and the boat began to gradually slow down. Of course, by this time there wasn't much left of it save the seat that Zehst was sitting on. As the momentum began to die off the boy found himself spinning in circles, then ricocheting off an uneven cobblestone to crash through the wall of someone's shop.
""Aha-cough! It did--huck, hagh, ew cat hair--it did work! Zehst my man, you're two for two today!""
As the dust and wood chips cleared, Zehst stood up with the cat from before now held in his outstretched arms and several new, apparently unnoticed, scratchmarks turning his face into bloody hatchwork. He looked around the crash site and spotted several people and an old man. One of the big guys had a nose ring.
""Hey, uh...I don't suppose you guys know where I could get a new boat, do ya?"" he asked, nervously throwing the cat over his shoulder. It let out a loud yeowl, then in the distance there was the sound of someone's garbage being scattered and glass breaking. </s>"
265,"<s>[INST] Lucretia squinted her eyes, watching the sun slowly rise over the blue edge of the ocean. This was, most certainly, the earliest she had ever woken up in her life. She had chosen to wake up so early specifically to see the sunrise, as a sort of good-luck charm for her upcoming… endeavor? Her adventure? She still hadn’t decided what to call it -- whatever it was, it was going to be something grand.
...That sun really was bright, wasn’t it? Maybe she could have afforded to sleep in an hour or two, after all. Well, no time for regrets! Now was more the time for action! Now was also, perhaps more pressingly, the time to sneak away before her parents (or her sister…) woke up. She pulled her legs up, standing on the edge of Savaronitelle Manor’s roof. For one last time, she surveyed the grounds, enjoying the feeling of superiority that standing on a tall object gave her.
“Ms. Lucretia? What are you doing up there?”
...Oh dear. Their butler had seen her. Lucretia scowled. Just her luck… “What business is it of yours?” she asked. “This is my parents’ property, I can go wherever I please!”
The old manservant scratched his beard. “Of course it is, madam,” he said, “But it’s not like you to be up so early. Is something the matter?”
Lucretia’s scowl faded, replaced with a certain h [/INST] esitance. She paused a moment. “How did you even know I was up here? I was doing my best to be hidden…”
The butler pointed a gloved hand to the extended ladder that Lucretia had set up against the wall of the manor.
“Oh,” Lucretia said.
Sighing a bit, she climbed down the ladder, turning to look at the butler. “Well? It’s not a crime to be out this early, is it?”
“Er-- no, but-”
Lucretia smirked, sensing that she had the advantage. “Go back inside. I hate interruptions like this - you’re spoiling my sunrise!”
The butler, nodded, sensing that his job could be on the line here, and hurried back inside without a word further. Lucretia watched him go inside, before looking back up at the manor. She had thought before that she might feel homesick - but she didn’t. The only thing she felt right now was a steely resolve.
“...Hmph… when I come back here, you’ll see.”
Without another word, she turned away, walking out of the front gate of their mansion. She didn’t look back… if only because she was distracted by the strange sight of a rocket-propelled dinghy flying through the air down in Loguetown proper.
And crashing. Into some building.
“...!”
Not wasting any time, Lucretia took off, running at full bore down the hill and into Loguetown - beelining straight for the crash site. </s>"
266,"<s>[INST] The patrons of the shop all stared flabbergasted at their new arrival, some looking back in disbelief at the hole where once stood solid wall.
Nose Ring, however, had quickly gone from stunned to beside himself. Stomping up to Zehst and forcibly prodding him with a long, bony finger.
""Where the HELL do you get off, interrupting our business!?"" He said loudly, prodding Zehst with his finger at every enunciation. ""This is the SECOND line of bullshit I've had to d [/INST] eal with in the past five minutes! Can't a guy shake down an old man in PEACE!?""
Meanwhile, along his walk through the city streets, Scabbard had come across the site of the grisly murder of a poor cabbage cart.
""....Woah, what?....""
He slowly approached a nearby cabbage on the ground and picked it up, staring at it with tired, sad eyes.
""....Dude...."" He quietly mused to himself mournfully as he took a bite out of it. ""Who's got, like,...a veggie vendetta?...."" </s>"
267,"<s>[INST] A large, balding man with a curly mustache and a gut as round as a pig’s let out a heavy sigh as he watched the sun rise over the town. He had his arms crossed and was seated on a crate of cabbages going by the label on the back side of it. There was a long, thoughtful pause after that, and he let the sun rise on his face before finally speaking. As he turned to his right, his expression softened just a bit as he stated, “I think it’s a sign too, Teej.”
Teodore Jay Dugrass was seated atop an empty barrel, his top-heavy physique and younger appearance contrasting with that of the older man. His expression lit up as the old man expressed his approval. “Right?!” He hopped off the barrel and looked back to his former boss with a grin, “It’s gotta be a sign if this happens right when I’m considering leaving!”
The “this” in question refers to the charred remains of a restaurant laying behind the two. Hours prior, the once proud restaurant “Homme Gros” suffered an explosion by the hands of a newbie employee. How exactly they did it boggled everyone’s mind, but containing the resulting fire and saving as much of the building as possible was more important then. Unfortunately, the fire was so severe, the only things that could be saved was the money made that day, a crate, and a barrel.
Flashing back to the present, the portly man let out a groan as he shifted in his seat. “Well, either way it’s just as good for me too. I’m pretty sure running that restaurant was what made all my hair fall out.” He chuckled as he rubbed at the noticeable bald patch on his scalp.
“Heh. A shame that it had to end like this, though,” TJ sullenly replied as he looked back at the rubble.
“Bah. No use wallowing on your “dream resignation.” We both know you wouldn’t’ve left unless I closed up shop myself.”
“True, true. In my defense, it would be unbecoming of a gentleman if I simply left at the peak of your business.”
“Hah! You keep telling yourself that, Teej.” The portly man got off his crate and hefted it up with a groan. “I’ll figure out what to do from here. Maybe I can finally cash in on so [/INST] me insurance. Get me some easy retirement money.” He chuckled again and looked back at TJ, giving him a confident smile, “You should get back home now. I bet you got some stuff to take care of before you set out. Good luck out on the sea, Teodore. You’re gonna need it!” On that note, he finally turned back to the road and started walking away.
TJ wasn’t going to just let his boss of seven years simply walk away without a word back from him, so gratefully he bowed his head and firmly shouted, “Thank you very much, Monsieur Pierre!”
And thus came an end to one chapter of TJ’s life…
Wasting no time, TJ just started making his way back home. He decided to leave the barrel where it was, figuring if he needed it for whatever reason he could always just come back to it. For now, though, he had to pack! He had to get ready! He… probably should’ve asked for a business-starting loan from Monsieur Pierre, now that he thought about it, but what’s done is done.
As he walked out from an alley he heard the sound of something sailing through the sky. Looking to the side, he saw something quickly approaching in the distance. Was that… a dinghy?? And… someone on it?? He noticed it to be an awfully dinged up dinghy the closer it came. That thought couldn’t be entertained for long, however, and TJ let out quite the un(gentle)manly yelp as he recoiled back into the alley, just narrowly avoiding getting rammed full force by what was left of the hull.
""That nearly gave me a heart attack!"" he thought. It took a few seconds for him to catch his breath, but when he did he peeked out from the alley. The dinghy was gone, but he noticed that it apparently rammed through a cabbage cart in its wake. Stepping out from the alley, he walked up to the remains of it and sighed. “What a waste…” he remarked.
Noticing someone else also inspecting the wreck, TJ turned his attention to them. He spied with his little eye something black-haired! Something with a huge sword! Something hORRIFICALLY BURNT AND SCARRED. Seeing Scabbard up close all of a sudden elicited his second un(gentle)manly yelp of the day. </s>"
268,"<s>[INST] So this is Loguetown, huh?
Giko shaded her eyes and squinted, peering over the town. From the crashes, bangs, and rapidly-forming crowd, it seemed like some rough-and-tumble sorts were starting a brawl down by the shopping district. Golly, she didn't want to be a part of that. More importantly, it was lunchtime, and that meant Giko had to think about getting some lunch! One couldn't make friends on an empty stomach, after all. Somewhere good to eat, though... The shopping district was crawling with rubberneckers, so that was out. Even if she got through, all the places would probably be shut tight until those hooligans calmed down. Maybe she should ask a local?
She clattered her way around the plaza, accosting passers-by who, for their part, gave her a wide berth and refused to make eye contact, instead glaring at something behind her and muttering something about a pervert. Giko tried turning around, but she couldn't see anything out of the ordinary. Was it her clothes? Something on her face? Or maybe...
Maybe she had a stalker.
An extremely sneaky stalker who was directly behind her at all tim [/INST] es.
It made perfect sense. A fragile young maiden like her, clearly new and unsteady in an unfamiliar land- why, of course she'd have a stalker. That was obvious. So obvious that she now wondered why she hadn't thought of it before, even. She had to report this to the local authorities at once. Evidence, though... It would be tricky to make a sketch if she didn't even know what he looked like. Giko needed, if not a friend, an ally.
Giko moved up next to a girl wearing some sort of shells over her ears- weird fashions, these locals- and tried to get her attention.
""Psst!"", she hissed.
""Psst! Hey, you! With the pink hair!""
No response. Clearly, those fashionable shells must have muffled her hearing. Giko would have to get the girl's attention another way.
A limp-wristed wooden hand clattered over Claribel's shoulder, followed shortly by a lifeless, artificial face creeping into view, far too close for comfort. Had it been an ordinary person, this method of approach would have been strange. Done by a puppet, it was downright surreal.
""Heeeeeeeeey theeeeeere~"", Giko whispered, giving the girl a wink. </s>"
269,"<s>[INST] Zehst's expression changed from a bashful smile to a quizzical stare as Nose Ring stomped over towards him and demanded to know why he'd interrupted them. But before Zehst could answer, the man poked him, none too gently, with each shouted word. At first he pushed the man's hand aside.
""Stop that."" he said, chuckling. It kind of tickled. The next poke was harder, and Zehst's eyes narrowed. ""Stoppit."" He lightly slapped Nose Ring's hand away. A harder poke. ""STAHP."" With the childish exclamation he grabbed Nose Ring's hand and actually pushed it away. But then here it came again, another pointing finger headed for his chest--
""I [/INST] NEED AN ADULT!""
With a ""shoop"" sound, a metal cylinder suddenly just grew out of the young man's elbow, at an angle to the rest of his arm as he drew it back. As his fist clenched tightly, the rocket flared to life, sputtering just once before sprouting a bright orange-white flame from its end.
""CRUISE KNUCKLE!""
At high speed and with considerable force behind it, the rocket powered punch headed right for Nose Ring's gut. Zehst was even leaning in, putting all of his shoulder and body weight into the blow. It most certainly would not be a cruise, but then it was named for the cruiser missile, not the popular vacation transport. </s>"
270,"<s>[INST] Of all of the stores in Loguetown, the old shopkeeper's one that was probably boasting the most action right now; gangsters, more gangsters, and a young rocketeer that crashed into a building using a dinghy, asking where he could buy a new boat.
The question would mark the ""arrival"" of yet another person.
""I know a store that sells boats."" A unknown voice said. Although as far as anyone would be able to see, the voice had no owner.
""I think it's called 'Sink or Sail' or something like that.""
As the voice continued to speak, it became increasingly clear where it was coming from. At that moment, one of the lids of one of the few crates that were dotted around the store burst open, revealing a young teenager with dark brown hair and wearing blue and exotic ninja garb. This was [/INST] Tenmon Tamashi, the weirdo enigmatic teenage ninja that had asserted himself in Loguetown only a few months ago. His appearance from the crate raised several questions: How did he get in there? How long was he in there? Why was he in there? Why did he decide to come out now, of all possible times? What's more, he didn't even seem to properly assess what exactly was happening in the store right now, being focused on explaining where the boat store was to the man who had crashed into the building and broke his dinghy (tee-hee) rather than the brawl now taking place in front of him.
""It's west from here, past the broken execution platform and next to the old Arms Shop."" The boy said, pointing roughly in the direction of where the store was.
At least his directions were accurate. </s>"
271,"<s>[INST] I AM AN AD-
Is all Nose Ring was able to say before he was quickly silence in shock at the sight of the boy's arm turning into a rocket. Was his eyes deceiving him!? Was this....
""...the legendary devil frui-!?!""
Was all he was able to say before the Cruise Knuckle impacted his midsection with incredible force. He let out a throaty, gagging cry of agony as fist met gut, before being launched right through another wall, his legs dangling over the bottom of the hole as he lay on the ground outside, bloodied and white-eyed.
The other gang members, who were not at the right angle to see Zehst's arm transform, were at once shocked and angered.
""Oi! This kid's no joke!! Who is he!?""
""Maybe he's a hitman sent by the Sugar Boys!""
""NOBODY puts Peppa th [/INST] rough a wall like that 'cept his Ma! You're asking for PAIN, hitman!""
The men all drew their weapons on Zehst, ready and willing to use them. The tension however, soon gave way to an awkward silence as they all witnessed Tenmon Tamashi stealthily rise from his crate.
"".......""
One of the thugs leaned towards another.
""It's that weirdo ninja again....""
""What! You looking for a fight, too!?"" One of the thugs said as he turned his sword from Zehst to Tenmon Tanashi.
Meanwhile, back at the destroyed cabbage cart, Scabbard looked up from his cabbage breakfast at the ripped fellow who just let out a very un(gentle)manly yelp right next to him. He stared at him incredulously, raising a thin, black eyebrow.
""...Dude....Did that just come outta you?..."" </s>"

Feeling something on her shoulder, she realized how wrapped up she was getting. A bit groggy, she lifted one side of the TDs, turning to look at her caller.
""Heeeeeeeeey theeeeeere~"" the voice of the firm face spoke out, a wooden shutter clunking closed over one of the eyes.
""GUHEEEEE!"" Claribel cried out like some kind of ro [/INST] dent, thoroughly spooked, bouncing a few steps away. Landing on her feet, her eyes were wide as she stared at the girl puppet and...uh...some guy.
Tapping the button on her TDs, pausing them, her expression was vacant as she blinked, looking over the pair. W-was this some kind of show? There really wasn't anyone else around: Claribel stuck to quieter areas when listening to music, whether on purpose or not.
Raising a hand, she greeted, ""G-good morning?"" Actually, had Claribel eaten yet? She was just gonna steal her boss' lunch but that wasn't happening today... </s>"
273,"<s>[INST] That shriek confirmed it. Giko definitely had some sort of pervert lurking just outside her cone of vision. How terrifyingly clever! Loguetown deviants were really something else!
""Shh, don't react! We don't want to provoke him."", She whispered, ""I need to ask you something. Act. Natural.""
She put her other hand overtop the first to steady the pink-haired girl. From her demeanor, it was clear: This stalker was not just any e [/INST] veryday stalker but some sort of highly-advanced superstalker who terrified even witnesses into silence. Definitely not someone to be trifled with. She'd have to navigate this scenario with extreme caution. Giko withdrew a sketchpad and a carpenter's pencil from a bag hanging at her hip, preparing to draw.
""I need you to describe the person standing behind me. His face, especially."", she whispered slowly, ""-Can you do that?"" </s>"

Location: Logue Town - Outside the Store
Mentions: 

The vicinity about the store became assaulted by a noise—a musical noise that sounded cheerful and uplifting, and at the same time strange for someone was…yodeling. The yodeler appeared outside the hole where the gang leader known as Nose Ring laid in an unconscious stupor. The man wore a black long coat over a white tunic-like shirt. In his right hand, he carried a long musket and in his left, he held a poster. His teeth came together in a brilliant grin as his yodeling ceased. His blue eyes scrutinized the etching on the poster and the man at his feet.
“Well, what do you know, the works all done for me,” said the gunm [/INST] en. He reached down to flick the massive nose ring that stretched the scumbag’s nostrils. What was the point? Why would anyone sacrifice beauty for a bull ring? He didn’t understand it—not to say the guy was beautiful to begin with.
Chamber straightened and peered inside the store to see several of Nose Ring’s possible henchmen surrounding two other individuals. He raised a hand to his head, his fingers reaching beneath his settler’s hat to scratch his blue hair. Did he want to get involved?
…
Grinning and waving to the individuals in the store, Chamber quickly bade: “Thanks for the freebie!”
Snagging Nose Ring by the ring of his nose, he started quickly dragging him away to turn his big-ass in. </s>"

What was supposed to be a typical shake down, had turned into quite the commosion in a matter of minutes. Although apparently saved, the shop owner did not look releaved. As a matter of fact, he appeared a bit more anxious that he was before. His eyes frantically kept count of the individuals in his store along with the curious bystanders that gathered outside.
“This isn’t good; not good at all.” The old man thought to himself as he began to profusely perspire. A gallon-worth of cold sweat suddenly trickled down from his entire body. It made you think, what had him so worried?
Trembling and in a panic, the shop owner rushed towards Chambers. “Faster, faster. You have to leave!” He said as he forcefully kept on pushing on the gunman’s back.
“Everyone, out!” He even motioned the rest of the Spice Boys to head out the door. The day was supposed to be simple; he’d get beaten up and lose some money, that was the worst case scenario he had thought of. Sadly, he was obviously mistaken.
With the series of events that had transpired, the unconscious Nose Ring along with his lackies were left stupefied for a few moments. The mercenary they hired was lousy, their boss was puched through a wall, random kids keep popping out of nowhere, and now the old man they were about to beat up was ordering [/INST] them get out of the store.
A clenched fist suddenly crashed into the face of the old, forcing him to the ground with his nose bleeding and broken. All he coud do was cry out in pain.
“Not sure whatcha tryin’ to pull here, but we still gonna be takin’ yo money, gramps!” 
With their boss temporarily out of the picture, it seems the grunts had become proactiv. Their job was simple though, get the cash and beat up whoever gets in your way. The atmosphere was getting rowdier and the fact that more goons were entering the store didn't make things any less troublesome.
""Don'tcha worry kiddos. After we're done with him, you guys are next. You gonna see firsthand what happens when you mess with the Spice Boys.
Simultaneous laughter and chuckles filled the shop as various types of weapons were being brought out; chains, swords, pipes, brass knuckles, daggers, you name it. Although muscleheaded, these mooks meant bussiness.
""Trash the place!""
OOC: Since these are small update, I plan to type up more as soon as people start to post. I know its kinda boring now, but we'll get to the juicy stuff eventually. Anyway, there's an unlimited amount of fodder you can take out if you want. Or maybe you want to help out the old man? Or maybe just run away from the place if you don't want to get involved in a fight this early into the story. Up to you. Have fun! </s>"
276,"<s>[INST] Somehow, things had managed to go extremely badly in the span of a few minutes; the shopkeeper was knocked out, the gangsters had become restless, and more of them were entering the store by the second. At this rate, the Marines would take notice and turn the fight into an all-out war.
""Huh. Things have gotten interesting."" Tenmon said, narrowly dodging a sword swing from one of the gangsters.
""Die, bastard!""
The Spice Boy goon took another swing at Tenmon. The young ninja jumped over both the blade and the gangster, his feet planting themselves on the shop counter. He briefly considered using his powers right there and then, but shook his head as he dismissed the idea; that would just destroy the old man's store even more. Tenmon needed to get outside before he started using his Burst Technique™.
""Ninja Arts: Flash Step!""
Tenmon took a low stance and darted forward, systematically stepping on the shoulders and heads of the various goons as he made a move for the door, deftly avoiding the series of weap [/INST] ons that were swung as the brawl continued. Dashing through the exit, he could've sworn that he accidentally stepped on someone that wasn't a goon there... Bah, forget it - they'd be fine.
Tenmon smirked. He was outside now. He could go all out. Some of Nose Ring's thugs were already outside, and more of them had followed Tenmon from inside the store too. A group of the thugs ran towards Tenmon with their weapons drawn, aiming to beat him to a pulp.
""Ninja Arts: Chi Burst!""
Tenmon thrust both of his hands outward toward the mob, releasing two explosions from his palms that enveloped the gangsters and sent them spiralling backward, with scorched bodies and white eyes telling of the teenager's mass K.O. The noise from the explosions rippled through and shook a portion of the town, alerting those nearby that something was going down in the shopping district.
The boy turned to face the remainder of the gangsters around him, drawing his ninjatō and taking another low stance which would foretell his next move. </s>"
277,"<s>[INST] Zehst smirked as he punched the guy with the nose ring through the wall. That'd teach him to be a weird pokey person. The young man listened to the exclamations of the two henchmen with a raised eyebrow. Hitman? What was that? Well, he had hit the guy...and he was definitely a man, last he checked...Zehst nodded to himself. He probably was a hitman! Then the crate next to him burst open, as a mysterious voice told Zehst where he could find a new boat. Who was this mysterious individual, who brought the good news of new dinghies to those who had no dinghies left?! It was...it was...
Zehst honestly had no idea who it was, but his outfit looked neat.
The thugs must not have thought so, though, because they turned their weapons on the new guy too. Zehst frowned. He had no idea where the Arms Shop or the Execution Platform was, so he would probably have to ask for directions. But he couldn't do that if these guys used their weapons on the new guy to chop him up! He would have to--
""WHAT IS THAT GODAWFUL NOISE!?"" The rocketman suddenly shouted, clapping his hands over his ears. Someone was walking towards the shop, someone who was...emitting some kind of sonic weapon from his mouth! Zehst's eyes bugged out of his head. Who was capable of such destruction?! Even the weapons his parents invented hadn't been so...so...
Annoying!
The guy grabbed Nose Ring by the...nose ring...and said something, but Zehst didn't hear it because he still had his hands over his ears. When he noted that the strange reverberations threatening to break his brain [/INST] had stopped, however, he let his hands drop back to his sides. Suddenly there was a lot of commotion as the old man told them all to leave the store, but the other guys weren't having any of that. In fact, more of them came in, and things were starting to get really violent.
""Well, this looks like fun!"" he said. The fellow in the cool outfit seemed to agree, and promptly proclaimed his Ninja Arts before leaping into the air. He stepped on Zehst's head, prompting an ""oof!"" from the rocket man before he repeated the process with several more heads, leaping out of the store.
""Hey, you--"" Zehst started. Then there was a big boom. As Zehst stood there, a horrified expression growing on his face, a white light seemed to envelop everything around him, reducing his surroundings to black lines like they were in a manga or something. Seconds later all the color came back, but the explosion had wiped several of the Spice Boys out.
""Stinger Strike!""
With the by-now familiar sound, a metal funnel shape blossomed from Zehst's left shoulder like a flower bud, and within it a fire bloomed before he was rocket propelled out of the shop, his feet sliding on the ground as his right arm pointed his elbow at his target. It looked a lot like some kind of martial arts strike, but really Zehst had just naturally felt like this was the best movement for what he had intended to do when he first practiced this move.
He surged forward, attacking--not the Spice Boys, but the mysterious man!
""What weapon did you use just now!?"" He demanded. ""Who designed it!?"" </s>"

Claribel pondered on that as the puppet held up a sketchpad. There wasn't much natural about this whole scene in the first place, so if she was supposed to act like this was natural...hey, this was getting interesting. Stepping forwards, Claribel got a closer look at the guy: he had a bit of facial hair, and his clothes were on the muted side, but one of his arms was definitely inside the puppet girl.
Claribel giggled, waving her arm in front of her own face, ""Eh? There's no one behind you! You just spooked me."" Ge [/INST] tting closer, she looked over the pair, before grinning, grabbing the puppet by one of her arms. Stars starting to shine in her eyes, she glowed, beginning, ""Anyway, what's your name? What are you doing in the quiet part of town?"" As she asked, she thought she heard some rambunctious echoes from closer to the sea somewhere else in town. Probably nothing.
Excitement getting the best of her, Claribel's stomach let out a rumble. Claribel puckered her lips, before turning around, moving to pull her along. ""Let's get some food!"" </s>"

Lucretia staggered towards the shop, out of breath. She stopped by a wall, watching the new gangsters file into the shop.
“Oh… oh, dear. There really are a lot of them,” she mumbled to herself. “Perhaps this wasn’t such a--”
She stopped. That ninja… was he the one on the flying boat? He had to have been, it certainly wasn’t one of those thugs there… Well, that put a wrench in her plans. How was she supposed to recruit him into her Very Own Pirate Crew if he was busy beating up some dirty street gang? There was only one solution she could see here--
Her train of thought was more or less interrupted by the massive explosions. She balked. This mysterious figure… he had some kind of special power as well! That settled things. If she wanted to get him on her crew, then she would definitely have to--
Lucretia’s scheming was once again interrupted - this time, by some kind of ‘rocket-powered man’ [/INST] attacking the ninja from within the shop! Perhaps he was the one on the boat all along? Lucretia shook her head dismissively. Her first day as a pirate was already far more chaotic than she ever expected. But, of course, that only meant it was time to restore order -- didn’t it?
She scowled. As far as special powers go, she really did get the short end of the stick - why couldn’t she turn into something nice, like a cat or a giraffe? Oh well. She focused, growing taller and - well, greener. By the end of it, she stood nearly eight feet tall, with weird bug eyes, a set of antennae, and two inordinately sharp, blade-like claws jutting out from her arms. Without further ado, Lucretia rushed towards Zehst and Tenmon, bowling over any gangsters that happened to be in her way.
“Both of you boys - whatever you’re fighting about,” she yelled, “Stop it right now! I’ve got a business proposition for the two of you!” </s>"

""What weapon did you use just now!? Who designed it!?""
It was the rocketeer again, but he was... charging? At him? Tenmon knew it: he did step on somebody that wasn't a goon! The young ninja tapped his palm with a fist as he made the realization. At that moment, another non-goon arrived. It was a... giant mantis? A talking giant mantis? Were those native to Loguetown? Were they native to the East Blue even? A series of questions rushed through Tenmon's mind to the point where he barely processed what the mantis-woman was saying - something about fighting? He didn't have time to talk about fighting; he was fighting!
""Hang on talking mantis, I have to defeat these gangst—BLEUGH!""
Amidst the commotion of gangsters and giant insects, Tenmon had forgotten that he needed to dodge the attack from the rocketeer. The elbow thrust struck Tenmon [/INST] in the face, sending him spiralling into the air — seriously, he must've spun like, 10 times during that 2-second airtime. It was fine though, Tenmon could easily stabilize his landing; he was a ninja after all. Well, he would've easily stabilized his landing if he wasn't being knocked straight into Nose Ring's gangsters. Sure enough, the young ninja barrelled straight into the thugs, inciting yet another explosion to take place as he collided with them head-on. Colour was removed from the area yet again as both light and smoke bellowed from the site of impact, obscuring both Tenmon and the gangsters he had been shot into.
The smoke began to dissipate, revealing a pile of knocked-out gangsters and Tenmon, who was laying atop the pile - still conscious. He sat up almost immediately, justifiably angry that he was just attacked by the same guy he gave directions to.
""Hey, Rocket Man! Why are you attacking me for!?"" Tenmon shouted, hopping off of the pile of gangsters as he did so. </s>"

I was expecting to have to fight a room full of thugs to get to this guy. It’s a good thing that there were some diversions in the area, the rifleman mused.
“There, 50,000 beli,” came the Post Steward. He slid the fat money purse across the counter and Chamber snatched it up, pressing the bag to his cheek as he nuzzled it like a kitten. “Don’t spend [/INST] it all in one place.”
Shouldering his rifle, Chamber gave the fakest and the most heroic-sounding of laughs.

""My name's Giko G. Gearbox!"", she said over the distant bangs and crashes of the shopping district, stumbling a little but more or less managing to keep up with Claribel's pace, ""What's yours?"" </s>"
285,"<s>[INST] Name: Gold Dorado Jr. 
Location: Logue Town - Ad Hoc Clinic
Mentions:   

""How does someone break their jaw by eating too much..."" 
Despite the grumbling, the speaker was a happy man. Despite being a well traveled man, Gold had never stepped foot in the near-legendary Logue Town, and at this rate he was unlikely to leave. Business was good, and the more criminally-inclined visitors didn't seem to care too much if their doctor lacked a doctorate. All they wanted was to be fixed up somehow, and they paid well enough for the effort Gold put in. At this rate, he'd have his debts paid off in...
In...
Gold brought a hand to his narrow chin as he began to consider the debts, lips pursed in contemplation. Average income per year if the work was consistent, compared to the (estimated) grand total he had among various casinos, money-lenders and other such institutions, considering any additional debts he's likely to rack up with his bad habits leads to...
""Three lifetimes."" He concluded in a groan. Unless he made himself immortal, Logue Town wasn't going to cut it and it was only a matter of months until Sharks and knee-breakers started showing up. Not that it was necessarily a problem, but it was a nuisance and one which made life unenjoyable. For a man who valued his good life, staying in one place and thinking about his problems wasn't a life he wanted to live. So the matter of the next location came to mind. Where to go next? He elected to take his thoughts with him on a walk, moving out of the dingy, run down little room he'd turned into his surgery and clinic, cigarette smoke and the smell of mold hanging in poorly-lit [/INST] room. Hey, the clients didn't seem to care about the conditions. They didn't complain, he wasn't going to spend the money to fix the place.
Taking his very, very expensive fur coat off the rack (which he bought on an impulse a year or so back) and slinging it over his shoulder, he embraced the salty air with a deep breath, rolling his shoulders.
He'd walked into a mess, apparently. A rocket-powered mess. The sight of a bug-lady, a wano-enthusiast, rocket-man and a collection of thugs made for an odd way to start the afternoon, but if anything it was just another day in Logue Town. One thing stood out to Gold though, above the other obvious oddities. They looked as if they were fifteen. Oh to be a teenager again, going from town to town, wasting the days away and... getting into debt. Mistakes were easier to make when you were young, not to say he did not get into trouble now, but he'd have less issues now if he had the same mindset he had now. Were these poor children, no older then twelve and without adult supervision likely to suffer similar fates? Regretting their choices in the years to come?
The good Samaritan in Gold found its feet and pushed him to act. He approached the colorful collection with a confident stride, regarding the three with simple smile and calming hand gesture.
""Swords, explosive limbs and antenna away, if you'd be so kind. Wouldn't want to attract the Marines, we'd all be in trouble!"" He played it off with a good-natured chuckle, hoping to defuse whatever had occurred between them. If push came to shove, he could put them on the naughty step and hope the Marines did not pick up on the fuss. </s>"
286,"<s>[INST] Because of that weapon! Zehst growled, shaking his fist at the ninja. His happy-go-lucky attitude had changed in seemingly the blink of an eye, once he had seen the explosions. Unbeknownst to anyone else, his mind immediately went back to that day on the beach. The day so many people had lost their homes, and their lives, because of something his parents had created. And now here was someone using something just as dangerous with reckless abandon. ""If that was designed by Messerschmitt Industries, you'd better tell me right now! Or else I'm gonna...I'm gonna...""
Zehst paused mid threat to turn his head, ever so slowly, to take in the giant praying mantis now looming over the two of them.
""Whoa..."" he said, just before his eyes lit up. The h [/INST] appy-go-lucky seemed to be back. Then he pointed at the ninja with a serious expression. ""YOU! If you have a net we can use to catch this cool huge bug thing, I'll forgive you for misusing that weapon just this once!""
Then someone else entered the fray, with the intent to calm rather than amplify the chaos. He encouraged everyone to stop fighting, so as to keep the Marines from coming.
""The Marines!?"" Zehst yelled, before looking back at the ninja. ""You better not be working for the marines, cool-outfit-guy! They shouldn't have those weapons either!"" Then he suddenly pointed at the man in the fur coat with an equally serious expression. ""And YOU'd better not be just trying to get us to leave so you can steal the huge bug thing for yourself!"" </s>"
287,"<s>[INST] Ah, yes! I know what you're referring to, TJ nodded to Scab, ""I haven't eaten breakfast yet either, though..."" He gave Scab another look over, a mite... put off by his appearance, but if the man claimed to have no money who was he- a gentleman who had money- to not offer any help?
""L [/INST] ay down your floor cabbage, my good man, I shall treat you!"" he loudly declared. He sounded very sincere about it too, but he just couldn't help but peer down to the end of the road again. ""...Unless, of course, you'd like to search for the whereabouts of our Crooked Cabbage Killer?"" </s>"
288,"<s>[INST] Scabbard blinked a few times, looking at the man, before realizing that he had been offered food. He sheepishly scratched the back of his head, flattered. He'd never been treated to food before, he always had to just quietly swipe it when everybody was looking away.
""....I'd love to!"" He said, eagerly, before pausing a moment to rethink his answer. ""But...We oughta go after the Cabbage Guy, yeah.....but I'm pretty hungry......but if [/INST] we catch the dude, we'll have bounty money to spend on food......but I could get food now....But then the Cabbage Dude might get away......I gotta think about this.....""
And so he put a hand to his chin and thought.
And thought.

He stared blearily at nothing, muttering to himself about which option to choose, for what felt like ages. It seems the decision would ultimately fall on the gentleman's shoulders....... </s>"

Claribel hopped towards Giko suddenly, but the two were about the same height, and Claribel's scale leaned all to way to cute as opposed to creepy, so it didn't have much impact.
Backing up, Claribel insisted, ""Hmm, that one didn't work, but it [/INST] could have! Anyway, I'm Claribel!""
Looking around, there was something she just needed to...aha! Running over to a certain open restaurant stall, she offered up some cash, getting some freshly baked, sugar coated little doughnuts in two little baggies, one for each of them. Taking Giko's, she speared one of them with a toothpick, holding it up to her. Claribel's eyes sparked with a clear interest in watching Giko eat. </s>"

It was becoming increasingly apparent to TJ that he wouldn’t be reaching a conclusion on his own anytime soon. But he couldn’t just impose his own will on him! That would hardly be gentlemanly!
………
His iron will crumpled as his overcooked friend entered yet another cycle of indecision. Clearing his throat, his voice cut into his train of thought like a deer stepping ont [/INST] o a busy road. Abrupt. “My good man! I say we capture this Cabbage Felon first! If he is indeed wanted, I see no harm in taking a detour from donuts if it means filling our pockets for spare food funds!”
He paused, realizing that his proposition required teamwork. And what sort of team didn’t have names to address each other with? “Ah,” he continued, “If we are to go ahead with that, we cannot simply remain enigmas to each other, correct?” He held a hand out to Scab. “Teodore Jay Dugrass! TJ for short! Good to meet you!” </s>"
291,"<s>[INST] Hearing the reasoning of the rocket man had managed to clue Tenmon in to what he meant.
Clearly, he had feared the amazing cutting power of Yugure - the high-quality ninjatō of the Tamashi Clan. While it was true that Yugure was a weapon capable of great feats in the hands of Tenmon, it wasn't so dangerous that he needed to be elbowed in the face for fear of him using it. Not at all; Tenmon would clear up this misunderstanding with haste - that's what ninjas do, after all.
""This weapon was designed by my clan, not an industry."" Tenmon explained, dusting himself off.
""You don't need to worry; I wasn't going to kill them. I'm a ninja, aft—"" His elaboration was cut off by the sounds of excitement from his attacker.
""YOU! If you have a net we can use to catch this cool huge bug thing, I'll forgive you for misusing that weapon just this once!""
Misusing the weapon? Tenmon didn't even get the opportunity to use the weapon, let alone misuse it. He wasn't the kind to misuse weapons anyway, esp [/INST] ecially not Yugu—
""The Marines!? You better not be working for the marines, cool-outfit-guy! They shouldn't have those weapons either!""
""What? The Marines don't wield weapons like mine."" Tenmon replied, doing a series of demonstrative slashes before intending to sheathe the weapon.
But before he had even started to sheathe Yugure, the rocket man had already started yelling at talking to someone else. The intense topic shifting here was a tad too fast for Tenmon to bother following - especially considering the fact that there were still some gangsters inside the store that needed to be dealt with, albeit some were just standing there in shock from the many different figures that had appeared over the course of their raid.
Surrounded by people of all kinds, Tenmon just, well, he waited: a lot had happened just then, and it would make more sense for him to hear out the mantis-woman before he did anything else, in addition to preparing for any impromptu attacks from that rocket guy again. </s>"
292,"<s>[INST] Scab's train of thought struck Dugrass's metaphorical deer at full speed, flying off the rails and soaring into outer space. He blinked as he looked back up at the gentleman, hearing his suggestion....Go after the Cabbage Killer, or course! Why didn't HE think of that?
He smiled a lazy smile at Dugrass and gladly accepted the handshake, lifting up his free hand and taking hold of the gentleman's. His skin was unsettling to touch: gnarled and knotted like ground beef, yet coarse and rough like sandpaper.
""Call m [/INST] e Scabbard, man..."" He replied. ""Like, uh...y'know, a sword. Like this one I got. Not like, uh....Not like 'Scab', like, uh.....like that thing that gets made when you get like a cut? That gross thing....People make that mistake sometimes, and it's kinda embarrassing, y'know?

“There, 50,000 beli,” came the Post Steward. He slid the fat money purse across the counter and Chamber snatched it up, pressing the bag to his cheek as he nuzzled it like a kitten. “Don’t spend it all in one place.”
Shouldering his rifle, Chamber gave the fakest and the most heroic-sounding of laughs. “Oh, I know where I’m going to spend this. Don’t you worry old man.”
With a cheerful sway in his stride and head as though he had a cheerful tune in his head, Chambers left the post, probably hoping to spend the money he had earned.
The windows of the post were shut and the doors were immediately locked by the guard. The steward then turned to the unconscious Nose Ring and offered him a glass of water.
“You okay, boss?”
His eyes suddenly opened as he slapped the glass of water away. Sitting up, he spitted out a copious amount of blood along with a tooth. “That punk got me good, huh?”
Those who were in the post were tensed and stood in silence, fearful of the man in front of them. “Anyway, we’ll deal with those kids later. For now, can someone get me a cigarette?”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The anger and frustration from the Spice Boys apparently disappated as most of them were now laying unconscious and flat on their face while the rest had fled the seen. Their utter defeat had crushed their spirits and the fact that they were dealing with mere children wasn’t helping them feel any better. To be fair, they had explosions and rockets on their side.
“I jad waned do take tome ol mahn daun.” Mumbled one of the downed goon as he tried his best to keep his weeping unnoticed.
“Pipe do [/INST] wn.” Said his fellow mook who was apparently piled on top of him. “They might come back for us and finish the job.”
Keeping quiet was a difficult task giving the flood of emotions that were filling him up; but since he was a Spice Boy, he had to do what he was told; biting his bottom lip was the only thing he could think of to lessen his snivelling. “Tory, I was dus tinkin o wa appen to da boss.”
Another lackey that was laying on top of the previous two suddenly spoke. “A bounty hunter took him, but don’t worry. Since it’s a Tuesday, we’ve got the post covered.""

The beautiful sunrise most sought out had already passed as the sun was almost at its peek. Time definitely flew and it was obvious who among the participants had the least amount of fun. With the rowdiness suddenly dying down, the shop keeper rushed towards the outside with bated breath, hoping to quell whatever what was left of the brawl that had started inside his store.
“Now, now. Let’s stop all this fighting!” said the old man as he grabbed the arms of both Tenmon and Zehst.”We definitely don’t want those marines to notice this little rumble, now do we?.”
He then turned to Gold and Lucretia, not being phased by the appearance of the large mantis beside him. “I’m not sure how the two of you got involved in all of this, but thank you for intervening.” The smile he projected made everyone feel how heartfelt his appreciation was for their help. “The important thing is that its all over now.”
He finally was able to let out a sigh of relief. “Now then, I can’t offer much, but would you allow this old man to treat you to some food?” </s>"
294,"<s>[INST] Nice to meet you, Claribel- and thanks for lunch! Or I guess this is more brunch, really.
She plucked the doughnut off the toothpick and crammed it into her mouth. So this was what having lunch with someone was like. It was nice- even if the other girl was kind of weird, and had shouted at Giko for no particular reason all of a sudden, but Giko was sure Claribel had her reasons. She leaned against a lamp post, across the street from the stall. It was small, ugly, and a unique cooking-oil-and-gunpowder aroma lingered in the air about the place. Three-fourths of the stall's face was dominated by a counter and a long, wooden bench. The remaining fourth was taken up by a workbench, above which hung a sign.
BLACK POWDER PETE'S POWDERED DOUGHNUTS AND FIR [/INST] EARMS
GUNS MAINTAINED WHILE YOU EAT
A small, ratlike man presumably named Pete worked behind it, frustratedly cleaning a pepperbox revolver and muttering something about ""these damned newfangled Marine toys"" as he did. Giko watched him absentmindedly as she ate, mangled bits of mashed-up, greasy dough falling out of her lifeless mouth as it worked up and down. The puppeteer, for his part, just eyed the doughnuts with obvious hunger, wiping a little drool off on the back of his sleeve. He seemed to be making do with just smelling them. Giko looked back to Claribel, the lower half of her face covered in crumbs and powdered sugar.
""So what's with the, uh-"", Giko tapped the side of her head, ""-The shells? Are they some kinda fashion around these parts?"" </s>"

Soon-to-be pirates, at least… that she was certain of.
Her stomach rumbled. Oh, right… That’s the unfortunate thing about running away from home in time for the sunrise - why, there’s simply no time at all to eat breakfast! And, besides… she could hardly say no if it was on the old man’s dime!
“I would be most obliged, my goo [/INST] d man! Here, let me just change into something a little less frightening and also perhaps less awe-inspiring...”
Lucretia spun around with a practiced flourish, shrinking back down and losing her weird, mantis-ish features until she resembled nothing more than some young noblewoman in an ostentatious dress. She smirked, looking back at the rest of the group.
“I might not have a name for this ability yet,"" she said, ""But it is positively grand, is it not? Hold your applause -- this is nothing for me, the great Lucretia Savaronitelle!” She laughed haughtily, curtsying to an imaginary crowd. </s>"

Pulling her silvery pair off her ears, she threw them over Giko's, giggling, ""This is a new one. Try it!"" Claribel tapped the button on the side, letting it play for the puppet.

Strolling down the street, the rifleman came across a sign that read: Black Powder Pete’s Powder Doughnuts and Firearms…
The advertisement had been enough to stop the man in his tracks.
“What? Guns and doughnuts?” Chamber exclaimed. He then smiled. “I got to go meet the genius behind this business strategy.”
He meant no sarcasm. Doughnuts and guns; it was ingenious! The owner must had made over a thousand beli a day. As Chamber approached the store, his blue eyes happened to stray over to two young ladies who were casually listening to music. The rifleman’s pace slowed until he stopped and stared at them. A rosy hue blossomed on his cheeks as his eye [/INST] s began to twinkle with………………………………………..LOVE!
Lips stretching into a firm line of determination, Chamber marched over to the woman of his dreams, fist swinging with purpose like a toy soldier. He stopped right behind Claribel, invading her personal space. His eyes were tensely staring passed her. SHE WAS IN THE WAY!
“You!” Chamber exclaimed. He then stepped around Claribel to face Giko while she was engrossed in Claribel’s music. He took her wooden hand in his own, which he saw her as being as real as any babe made of flesh, and took a knee in front of her.

True, the explosions hadn't been super huge...and they seemed to be mostly light and show, if the force behind them was only enough to knock the bad guys out.
""Well...if my parents didn't make it, and you're careful about how you use it...then I guess that's your freedom, huh?"" he said, before nodding to himself. ""Sorry about hitting you, then. I just...have a thing about weapons of mass destruction."" He rubbed the back of his neck and smiled bashfully. ""I'm Zehst, Zehst Messerschmitt, by the way. I ate the Roke-Roke Fruit, so now I'm a Rocket Man!"" A small set of turbines opened up in the hollows of his ears, spitting flame to emphasize his point, before with a ""shwoop"" they withdrew.
The old man they had inadvertently helped offered to feed them, at which Zehst's stomach rumbled like a [/INST] B52 jet. He nodded heartily to the geezer, but then the cool giant mantis said, in a surprisingly girly voice, that she had to change first. The mantis spun and shrank, mandibles and arm-blades disappearing as chitin became skin, and in its place soon stood a lovely young lady, who introduced herself by name. Zehst pointed, his jaw dropping and eyes bugging out.
""Ah, cool-outfit-guy! The giant mantis can turn into a pretty girl! How're we supposed to catch her now!? I'm no good with girls!"" he said, his voice rising an octave higher. Because he'd been cooped up in his mansion with only his parents and his tutors and a babysitter for company, he'd never really interacted much with kids his own age.

Giko continued her attempts to eat, a small crowd of gulls gathering around to pick up the mashed-up chunks of food as they rolled back out of her mouth. The puppeteer seemed firmly focused on the bag of doughnuts to the exclusion of all other events presently occuring, but that didn't seem to keep Giko from interacting in the slightest.

Scab…bard. Scabbard. TJ understandably nodded along as he related his Scab story. Nobody would want to be called a scab… Those are gross!

""She's a devil fruit user, and if I had to hazard a guess, she ate a pretty good one too. Probably best if you didn't try to catch her."" He left an element of jest in his tone.

The gangsters had been subdued, Nose Ring was taken away by a bounty hunter of sorts, and the store was (sort of) intact. What's more, the shopkeeper was appreciative of the state his store was in, even offering to take the impromptu group to a restaurant, of all things! Just how bad would it have been if the group of oddities weren't there?
Probably not as bad, honestly - but that's neither here nor there.
Aside from that, the Rocket Man had introduced himself to Tenmon. His name was Zehst. Zehst Messerschmitt. Not only that, but he revealed that his power came from a Devil Fruit. Although Tenmon had already deduced that a while ago, given that he had learned the ins and outs of Devil Fruits when he was younger. Too bad he had only gotten that explanation after he had eaten one.
""Roke-Roke Fruit..."" Tenmon said, thinking about the power.
""I assume it's a Paramecia type, right?""
Tenmon didn't wait for an answer. Instead, he watched as the mantis-woman became a... wo [/INST] man-woman? A Paramecia and a Zoan type? It was true, the closer you get to the Grand Line, the more Devil Fruit users you find. Of course, the Grand Line was full of people like that - himself included. The mantis woman was named Lucretia Savaronitelle. She seemed to carry a noble aura about her. Probably not on the level of one of those World Nobles, but definitely wealthy to some degree.
The Doctor also seemed to know about Devil Fruits. Gold Dorado Jr, they called him. Huh. The name had some similarities to the first Pirate King. Tenmon wondered if he got asked about that often.
At this point, everyone had introduced themselves in some way - except for Tenmon, who had said very little about himself through the entire ordeal. Bah. Ninjas don't reveal their identities, anyway. Yeah.

Well, it seemed like a good excuse. He'd just introduce himself later. That'd work.

Glaring down at the crowd of foul, he threatened, “If you guys don’t want to see this bird blasted all over the pavement, then you’ll get out of here!”
All the seagulls stopped eating to stare up at the gunman and regarded their friend who was trembling and wiggling his webbed feet in panic. With a war cry-like seagull squeal, the first bird angrily launched like a missile at Chamber to connect with his head.
“Agh! What the hell!?” he cursed.
Soon a flock of angry seagulls were pecking and bombarding him left and right. Rising to his feet, he swatted at the birds and found himself being slowly drawn away from Giko.
“You’re interfering!” he shouted. “My darling! Wait for me! I will return with fried chicken!” </s>"
306,"<s>[INST] The area immediately around Giko erupted into chaos as her newfound friends batted away the bird in her mouth while trenchcoat guy held a gun to one's head and screamed something. She couldn't really make out what he was saying, since her ears were still ringing from the TD set, but it was definitely very passionate and filled with righteous anger, so good on him. By the time she was finished coughing up feathers that had gotten lodged in her mouth-joints, the poor man was already halfway down the block.
""Well, he seemed nice enough."", Giko commented as the hotbloode [/INST] d seagull-threatener was carried away by a tide of birds. She reached down again to pluck another doughnut from the bag, only to realize it had been stolen in the confusion- one of the gulls, probably. Giko wiped her face on her sleeve and massaged her ears as she looked back over to Claribel.
""So that's a tone dial, huh? Technology these days is really something. I'd rather have something a little less... Well, loud. Anyway-"", Giko continued, running her hands through Claribel's hair, ""-So what do you use for your hair, anyway? It's so silky! Are you a natural pink?"" </s>"
307,"<s>[INST] The Director looked over the agents with hidden curiosity. They were all either quiet or engaging in mindless chit-chat to pass the time. The Director smiled as he looked over the files that were on his desk. ""Jacob Huntington? Dull background to the collection of people here. But still someone to keep an eye on. Counselor, what happened to the last shipment of experimental weapons. Binary rifles? Was that there name?""
The Counselor looked at his PDA and sighed. ""I am sorry to report sir but they are currently in rebel hands, they ambushed the delivery ships and stole the cargo.""
The Director slammed his fist down on the table making the Counselor jump. ""God damn it! These rebels stealing everything I try to get delivered! No matter. A perfect first mission for our new recruits but training time first. Then mission briefs.""
Pressing a button on his desk a woman's voice spoke out across the large hall, the voice had a robotic tinge in the way it spoke as she addressed the Agents in the large hall, who had now gone quiet.
""Welcome you are one of 49 elite military members who have been chosen for the new Freelancer project. We hope that you have gotten your self comfortable to listen to this recording as you will need to listen very carefully.
You will no longer be know by your Civilian names, instead you will be addressed by your new code names. Which will have already been assigned. This must be used at all time this is for your safety! Before entering live combat you will be hooked up with various armour enhancements and an extremely Valuable AI. This AI is suited to you and will help you use your new abilities safely and efficiently.
Working together is crucial to completing your objective and scoring high in the leaderboards. The leaderboards track your personal progress throughout your missions. No matter where you are on the leaderboard you will not be treated any differently, these leaderboards are for The directors and the boards so don't worry about them. There are a few rules that must be followed:

AIs must not communicate with each other.
No contact to the outside is allowed via any mode of communication.
Use of live weapons or abilities unless inside a training zone or on a mission is prohibited.
Obey any orders given to you by the Director or Counselor.

Thank you for your patience the Director will now address you"".
The Directors vo [/INST] ice followed the woman's after a short pause, he had made his way down to the center stage while the presentation was going.
""Good morning agents. To assess who is going to be implanted with what A.I. we will begin this morning with a round of sparring. We will be assessing how you fight and act individually and together. Your opponents will be military grade robots with military A.I.. You will be outnumbered two to one so take this into account. Please make your way towards the training facility now.""
The training facility in question was a large room filled with a simulation battle environment made to look like an abandoned village. All the agents would be able to use live round but their armour abilities would be disabled. Their opponents stand at the other side of the room, black suits of armour armed with simulation rounds that pack a hell of a punch but are not lethal.
Washington was the first in, looking at situation he grimaced. ""Man, robots punch like heavyweight boxers and take as much punishment as a tank. Not fair.""
Once all the agents were in a horn buzzed signaling the start of the exercise. The robots jumped to life taking up defensive position and throwing smoke grenades in front of them to cover their advance and Advance they did. Slowly moving forwards preparing to engage whoever got close.
Washington looked over at the rest of the agents. ""Hey guys and gals names Washington, these robots are going to be a bitch to take down. Word to note they'll keep on going even if you knock of their heads. They can take information from other bots to see so if one sees you they all see you. Only reason I know so much about these bastards is this ain't my first rodeo with them. Got stuck in a training simulator with two of them, they beat me good. So don't get caught and if you do have to hit them then hit them as hard as you fucking can! Apart from that...""
Washington pulled the pin on a grenade. ""Have fun!""
Vaulting over the wall he had been hiding behind he threw the grenade into the crowd of machines. They jumped away from the grenade and Washington was there to meet them blasting one in the arm with his AR he was met with a punch to the gut sending him flying over a wall. ""Son of a bitch!""
Raising his gun he let of a few bursts into the nearest bot taking it down before being hit by another robot on his left shoulder. Knocking him prone. </s>"
308,"<s>[INST] Maine listened carefully to the instructions, looking at his dark green freelancer suit. He had taking off the brush cover on it for a more sleek look, seeing as they would be doing training today. There was no shrubbery to really blend into. Cleaned his rifle, scanning through the other freelancers. They were the best of the best alright, some more than others, of all shapes and sizes. He didn't have to worry about taking them on it seems, just computed AI. They had an algorithm and a systematic way of doing things, but he didn't know how good these AI were. He would let the cannon fodder, or his teammates, sort that out.
As he got his armor enhancements, although disable, an AI was programmed into him as he saw a green figure materialize on his shoulder.
""Hello. I am Delta, your AI.""
""Oh, so you can talk?"" I think aloud in my head, looking at the hologram.
""Yes, I can talk Agent Maine. I am the AI designed for logic. I will be giving you combat feedback to make the best logical decisions on the battlefield to insure mission success and survivability.""
""Oh. Sounds like my kind of AI. So, are you just going to be in my thoughts forever like this?""
""No, I am here for when you need me agent Maine, mostly in combat and any other critical situations. If you would like, I can also give advice.""
""Alright, thanks Delta. Let's get into the training room and assess these bots. They say the leaderboard doesn't mean anything, but regardless it would probably be efficient to be near the top.""
""That is a logical guess.""
""So it's true?""
""I'm not sure, but I said it was a logical guess.""
""Did they program you with sarcasm?""
""Not intentionally.""
Maine set up near the back of the arena, laying down and adjusting his anti-material rifle as he scoped in to the robots. They seemed pretty resilient, and there would be 98 it seemed. From what Washington was telling us, head shots wouldn't kill them, so it looks like the upper chest would do the trick with the sniper. A useful bit of information. Once the battle begun, smoke grenades were dispatched right away as the robots charged forward under cover.
Maine looked through his scope, u [/INST] nable to see through the smoke as his tactical vision was disabled. ""Now where are they...""
""The majority of the agents will most likely engage in CQC, maintaining focus of the AI. Since they relay information instantly, you will be able to shoot two rounds before your location is pinpointed. I would suggest moving position after your second shot and to repeat the process while the others hold the front line. If they invade the back line, use your smoke screen as cover and regroup as to not get surrounded."" Delta announced, having Maine blink a few times.
""Wow, you are good."" Maine said amazed, wondering where the heck they got these AI from.
""Focus on the targets making progress into the back lines and any other enemy snipers supporting from long range. I have calibrated your computer in your sniper into my system, and I'll calculate each shot automatically for you. When you do take your shot, I will increase your adrenaline and reflexes and slow down heart beat and breathing for a more precise shot.""
""Affirmative."" Maine whispered, slowly taking this all in. Although control over these aspects of his body and weapon were a little unnerving, the AI seemed to know what it was doing.
The smoke was clearing as a single AI seemed to try to burst from the initial line, vaulting and attempting to punch a fellow freelancer. It was almost too quick, but time seemed to slow down slightly as he was able to line up the shot and fire, like it was in slow motion, but he was moving at normal speed.
A burst from the rifle shot out, suppressed by the muzzle as the thin bullet whizzed through the air at lightning speed. It ripped clean through the robot, blowing a huge hole in it's chest with it's head falling off as it crumbled to the ground. The bullet even went through the robot, piercing one or two others through the arm and imbedding itself in the back of the arena.
A small smirk appeared on Maine's lips as he resumed in rifle, picking out another target. This was going to make sniping a whole lot more fun.
""So, you said I had one more shot left right?""
""Yes, I told you that earlier Agent Maine.""
""Sigh... just, never mind."" </s>"
309,"<s>[INST] California stood off near the side of the group, arm folded as he listened to the Counsellor's and Director's instructions eagerly. Finally, the chance came to prove his strength and combat prowess within the Freelancer Program. Getting to smash up some tin cans sounded fun. As more and more of the details for the exercise were given, the wider and wider Arthur's grin got beneath his Soldier class helmet. Arthur looked around as he saw the other agents gear up after the instructions had ended. He turned to his weapons, which he gleefully picked up checking over his pride and joy, ""The Answer"" SAW variant. He had painted it himself, a skull with it's mouth open at the barrel, with the rest of it painted black with various slanderous terms and symbols. He did not give a fuck about censorship. It was then that his own AI made first contact with him.
""Hi!"" An energetic female voice said.
""Yo!"" Arthur replied in his head with equal amounts of enthusiasm. ""You the AI thingy?""
""Yup! I'm combat ready, California!""
""Good! I don't know your name though. But you already know mine."" He replied curiously.
""Oh! Silly me! I'm Chi. If the Director decides, I will be your permanent AI.""
""Neat, never had a permanent voice in my head........ arguably...."" He commented.
Once everyone was ready, the exercise began and [/INST] the combat robots were released. The guy who seemed to had experience gave a pep talk or something before engaging the enemies. He seemed to be in a spot, so California decided to assist Washington. He strafed to the other freelancer's direction, spraying his explosive rounds into the smoke and crowd of robots.
""You're coming up on the agent, California! Another ally is providing sniper fire for the agent."" Chi advised as she recognised that Arthur's focus was on attempting to empty his first clip of rounds. California acknowledged the callout, and gave a thumbs up to the apparently skilled sniper. Another robot dashed from the smoke, attempting to engage Arthur.
""Duck!"" Chi called out in his head. Arthur complied, barely dodging a solid punch to the helmet. ""Their head armour isn't as strong as the rest of them. Take it out!""
""Right!"" He said. California spun about 180 degrees, before extending his arm out to clothesline the metal can, decapitating the head right through the neck.
""Keep attacking! Not down yet!""
Cali slammed the barrel of The Answer into the chest and completely buried the last five rounds of his drum magazine into the stomach of the robot. He shrugged away the scrap heap before looking at the other agent he originally set out to help, lifting him up by the shoulder. ""You okay?"" </s>"
310,"<s>[INST] Montana half heartily listened to the instructions. All he cared about was when they would be breaking some bones. He didn't have to wait long it seemed as they were told they were going up against some military robots. He sighed in his helmet, slightly dissappointed that they weren't real soldiers to test on but it was going to have to do.
One of the other recruits, Washington, came forward briefly giving information on the robots before all hell seemingly broke loose. He laughed at Washington shortly after he was sent flying by one of the bots.
""Come on you can't take a hit?"" he said to his fallen comrade that in hindsight he would realize was stupid as o [/INST] ne of the other units slammed their fist into his chest having him skid across the floor and hit one of the barriers.
""I take it back,"" he groaned out getting up and zeroing in on the bot that had hit him.""All right lets see how many screws and bots hold you together."" He brought his shotgun out and ran forward aiming for the head, he blew the bots head off. He focused his attention on another robot, trying the same thing but it dodged and swept him off his feet with its legs.""Right they learn, got to remember that."" He hit the ground with his fist in frustration as he got up living a slight dent in the ground "",Well I wanted a fight, guess I have one now."" </s>"
311,"<s>[INST] Washington's head was spinning inside his helmet. Picking himself off the ground he grabbed his rifle which had landed next to him. ""That really hurt!"" Checking his ammo count he dusted of his armour. ""Let's rock and roll baby!""
Charging forward he let loose with a volley of bullets into his robotic enemies. Switching to his Sticky grenade launcher he fired it into the first robot he came across. It stuck to its torso, giving it no time to react he switched back to his rifle and stabbed it in the back and charged into a group of robots. One got a kick on him looseni [/INST] ng his grip on the robot the blade in its back sliding out and sending him flying over a wall.
Pulling out the detonator he smiled. ""Scrap metal it is then fellas."" Pressing the detonator the stuck robot exploded. Due to the robots being so bunched the damage blew two into pieces the other two from the group that attacked him were missing an arm or head but were relatively undamaged. They replied to his attack by reaching for him from behind the wall and picking him up from the ground by the neck.
""Oh come on, you're even worse then the last time! Little help guys?!"" </s>"
312,"<s>[INST] Ohio was sitting on a bench half-heartedly polishing her helmet, she didn't need to listen to the instructions, she'd seen something like this many many times over. Problem was, she sucked at these little exercises, something about killing people and even aliens was just so much easier. Not to mention her HSR was pretty much useless against non-organic matter, she could effectively destroy their comms and radio-wave broadcasting, which eliminated most machinery without on-board AI, but they had no brains to liquefy. Liquefy being the wrong word but it was pretty damn close and Ohio wasn't particularly interested in how it worked.
Ohio frowned slightly as her AI projected itself on her shoulder, Gamma, she didn't like him much and even though he was just a computer code she felt the feeling was mutual. That aside they were a good match, they were probably chosen because the director knew they wouldn't get along great. Gamma was a liar and a traitor with a lot of potential to harm, most people wouldn't be able to see that especially because Gamma was still so young and had exhibited so little of his 'personality.' It really took one to know one. Ohio also had the so called 'advantage' of having had her AI implanted a few days earlier than most, with some not even having any AI yet at all. She suspected that had to do with her AI's ability, a kind of time loop that let her try again and again until she got it right. Or in a recent case, until she survived. Since her AI would automatically start a loop if she was fatally injured. Ohio was pretty sure what she'd been through was the reason things are only supposed to die once. It was really the stuff of nightmares, as horrible as it had been at least she wasn't dealing with it for the first time now. Aside from that it really ruined the idea of organized religion for her because if she had been experiencing actual death, then they were all totally hilariously wrong.
""Agent Ohio, we are starting a training mission soon are you ready?"" His voice was like those really old robotic ones, before they figured out how to make them work better. Choppy, stiff, emotionless.
""Do I look ready?"" She chuckled, putting her helmet on and sealing it.
""I have complete confidence in you. The chances of fatality are designed to be very low, no death-loops.""
""Gamma, don't lie to me, we just met. You trust me as far as you can throw me, and you're literally a hologram so that puts us at square 0. Or like negative one. It's totally fair, I was kind of a dick yesterday. Dying a bunch just puts me in a bad mood."" She sighed and began to check over her hand guns. The others were beginning to move out.
""Yes that was rather apparent after the string of expletives you directed at the administrators.""
""If they try that again without telling me, and I won't do it in a time loop. It will be 100 percent organic, gluten-free murder."" Ohio muttered as she carefully watched her new team mates getting to work.
""Agent Ohio, excuse my directness, but now you are the one lying. Also murder is not a food so it can't have or be free of gluten."" His blue form flickering, just at choppy as his voice
Ohio rolled her eyes, ""Ok, yes but its a revenge fantasy. Humans love them, [/INST] have them all the time and if they tell you they don't they're a damn liar. Everyone has wanted to get back at someone at some point, the world isn't full of Gandhis and Martin Luther Kings, its a lot of normal people with a lot of normal flaws. Just ignore the gluten bit, I don't think you're going to get the joke."" She was standing now, looking for her entrance into the fight.
""I'm sorry I don't know who either of those people are but am I correct to assume they are morally superior to the average human?""
""Really? You guys didn't get a basic history lesson from before the war? Yeah sure morally superior or whatever, Christ if you were human you would have thought that sounded cool but now its just weird."" Her eyes were locking on to specific target zones, ""You know what forget it, I don't have time to teach you 20th century history right now."" Gamma nodded and flickered out of sight. With that she was darting on her way to help Washington who already had a robot half strangling him.
Ohio carefully made her way through the robot carnage. Carefully in the sense that she was booking it as fast as she could while avoiding getting hit by one of the robots. She charged at the robot from behind, wrapping her arm around its neck in a tight hold while keeping her other hand free for a knife.

""Ok so Wash, can I call you wash? You know what I'm going to call you Wash and you'd better not have a problem with it because I'm trying to help your ass. Anyway, listen, big guy over there,"" She gestured with the knife at California, ""has the right idea, you gotta go for the head but if you're like me, or you for that matter, and aren't a human bear you can't exactly crush their heads with your bare hands."" She shouted over the explosions and thrashing of the robot, trying to get her to let go.
""See what people like us do Wash, is we improvise."" She grinned as she plunged her knife between a small gap in the armor plates of the neck. ""The interesting thing is that we humans tend to make things that are like humans, that's the self-obsessed way we are. So a lot of these vital wires are in the neck, like a human's spinal cord. Which means all you have to do is get the knife in here and shake it around a bit."" She demonstrated by violently twisting and moving the knife in a kind of back and forth pattern. Some smoke and a few sparks came from the area her knife had sunk into but the robot was already letting Go of Washington as well as beginning to spasm uncontrollably. Ohio let go and gave the robot a hard shove to the ground.
""Sadly it's not totally dead cause its equivalent of a brain is still there but I've severed its ability to control it's limbs and most functions below the neck. Now it just sort of flops around like a fish. It's kind of sad actually."" She said, cocking her head and watching the robot. This moment of lapse however almost cost her as she barely dodged a punch that cracked the wall she was standing in front of. ""Well points for enthusiasm on that one."" She said with a short laugh before trying to repeat the process she had used on the last one, with a bit more difficulty as this robot was not already attacking someone else and was able to try much harder to throw her off. </s>"
313,"<s>[INST] So, it seemed a lot of idiots were running around the battlefield. Freelancers were throwing grenades, shooting people, getting pelted by non-lethal bullets and being thrown around like rag dolls. Maine couldn't help them all out, but it wasn't life or death either. Besides, this was mainly about him showing off his skills.
Another shot ripped through a line of robots, taking apart at least three as the high velocity bullet ripped through them like butter, after carefully calculating the shot of course. Knowing it wasn't safe to stay there any longer, Maine picked up his rifle, stood up and starting sprinting to a new position.
""There seems to be a scuffle between your Freelancer Allies, 10 o'clock. It looks like they might want some sniper cover."" Delta spoke, pointing over to where Ohio, California, and Washington were.
""Alright, I guess saving allies might score me points. Or at least brownie points with the others. Where's a safe place to set up where I can get a good angle?"" Maine thought in his head, diving behind a barrier.
""20 meters to your right, you can lay down next to that wall there and get a good aerial view of the situation. It should provide decent cover as well.""
Making sure the coast was clear, main jogged over to the spot, laying down prone with his tripod out as he settled into position. Breathing slowly out, Delta adjusted the computer on his sniper as Maine looked through the scope. It seemed Washington was picked up by a robot, before Ohio jumped on it's back and jammed a knife to it's throat. Now a robot was on her, a punch barely missing her.
Maine held his breath, his finger resting on the trigger as the reticule lined up dead center to [/INST] the thing's chest. Right as he saw this, he noticed out of the corner of his scope that a robot was holding a grenade near California and Washington, looking to chuck it there way. He would have to make a decision... or would he?
He felt his heart rate slow, only the sound of his heartbeat was audible to him as he let a slow breath out. His finger hit the trigger, a bullet leaving the barrel aimed at the chest of the robot in front of Ohio. About a few milliseconds later, the reticule was moved and the computer adjusted by Delta as a second bullet ripped through the air.
Almost immediately after, the first bullet cut clean through the robot's chest, blowing it apart with it's head flying to the side as what was left of it dropped in a heap. A split second after a billet sailed narrowly past Washington and California, going through the grenade that the second robot was going to throw. It exploded in it's face, blowing off it's head, it's arm, and part of it's body as it got propelled backwards and on it's ass.
""Nice job Delta."" He smirked, smoke curling from the silencer of the semi-automatic sniper as Delta turned around on his shoulder.
""Incoming."" Was all he heard before he felt himself get picked up by his back, being hurled across the stadium and through a wall, his rifle spilling out of his hands a few feet away from him. He groaned, grabbing his head.
""Ouch... why didn't you say anything?""
""I said incoming.""
""Yeah, right before he threw me through a wall.""
""I am not physically capable of stopping that from happening, agent Maine.""
""So I noticed..."" Maine groaned, coughing as he slowly got up, the robot slowly marching towards him like a bad terminator movie. </s>"
314,"<s>[INST] California smirked at Ohio's , quite frankly, flattering comments. ""Heh, maybe I should try that..."" He replied to the white armoured woman. He didn't have time for sneaking about and worrying about trying to be noticed. In his previous line of work as a Merc, plans that involved staying quiet ALWAYS went wrong, so why bother in the first place?
""If you're gearing up to fight, gear up right.""
That was the motto he was taught by his old commander. However, those days were behind him... and the ideas of stealth being useful did get into his stubborn head... somewhat. Back into the fight, Arthur began to reload his SAW, leaving the empty magazine to clatter on the ground before sliding in and securing the second clip of rounds. It was then when Ohio re-engaged with another enemy. She can take care of herself.
""California! More enemies on the right! Also... that sniper just went real far, real quick..."" Chi chirped into his ear.
Shit... tangoes approaching and another freelancer just got knocked on his ass. California had to think quick. And the idea he got had to be put into place... but it was really fucking stupid too... California shrugged and decided to roll with it. He holstered his gun and pulled out his grenades, one in each hand. ""Guys... cover me..."" He said to Washington and Ohio. California sprinted off into the group as fast as he could, barrelling into the [/INST] small crowd of robots. He bowled some over, and desperately fended off the couple still standing as he unpinned his grenades and dropped them into the crowd. Still making progress, Cali stepped away with only one grabbing onto his forearm. The Spartan grabbed the robots arm and swung them both away from the blast radius, performing what is technically called an ""Irish Whip"" as he sent the robot tumbling into a nearby wall.
He used this created opportunity to get away from the dropped grenades, set to go off at any moment. California grabbed the rifle belonging to Maine  and used the end of it to bludgeon the robot walking towards the groggy Agent. California tossed the sniper back to him. ""Here!"" He shouted. The robot was not fazed at all, and landed a swift kick into the Bear's back, sending him reeling away. ""Fuck!"" He yelled as he got spun into the direction of another combat robot, who used the opportunity to uppercut Arthur on the chin. ""Shit!"" He said again as he got effectively pinballed between the two. He regained his balance and looked over his shoulder as he jutted his elbow out into the chest of the previous robot, turning around and delivering a textbook right hook into the robot's temple. However, the other robot wrapped it's metallic arms around Arthur's waist, who tossed him into the wall Maine just got tossed into.
""Bastard! Fuck!"" He cursed again. </s>"

The group moved in synchronisation, one behind the other like a conga-line...If a conga line was armed with heavily loaded weaponry and explosives. One by one, they moved to their destination, a doorway locked between the inside and the downpour that spread on the outside. Yet, Grant wasn't among their ranks, as for one. He was placed elsewhere, with a view quite remarkable. Masked mostly by the rainfall and the darkness of the night, he gripped his Designated Marksman Rifle, blankly keeping a straight face when staring at the sights of both his and his comrades' successful takedowns. A pitter-patter of downpour tricked and mixed between a blood-stained concrete floor, creating a red, oozing solution against the walls. Once they were inside, Grant would have to depart, having no use inside with his weapon.
He could see them, moving step by step and rippling the puddles with each additional pace. Remarkable to see how they'd come so far, his brothers, sisters and comrades. When he grew up within the Insurgents, they were little-more than small time fighters, barely surviving the encounters they got into. But now, they were trained, armed and fitted out with appropriate weapons to even kill a Spartan if used correctly. They were growing in size, becoming an issue for the UNSC and other insurgent groups. That was their goal, to cause themselves to be noticed. It was so they could shift the focus of the UNSC occupation forces to those civilians in need, which were receiving little to none. And now the-
A sound fractured his thoughts. It sounded like heavy boots, from directly behind him. Grant was already laying down on his front, soaking up his combat vest into the watery walls of the UNSC FOB. He could hear boots coming closer, as he rolled onto his back quickly, DMR facing towards the sound. Yet, before he could react and pull the trigger, a sight of shock came to him...In the form of a Shock Trooper...A Orbital Drop Shock Trooper...A squad of or-...You get the fucking point.
Four of them, encircled around him, all with guns aimed at his chest. Now, everything seemed to stand still. The rain continued to splatter against the helmets of the ODST specialists, as well as the Rebel attire of Grant, but not one uttered a word. At least for the moment in time. They all stared at each other, blankly through visors and heads up displays, before eventually Grant broke the moment of silence and awkwardness.
""Hey guys...I think I saw the Rebels go that way."" He couldn't help but grin underneath his own visor, but the ODST didn't see the funny side of it, one of the central soldiers placing their heavy boot against his chest to keep him on the floor, the other leg kicking away the DMR in his hand. The silence retained for a small while longer, and yet it remained awkward and painful for the rebel on the floor. His voice coughed and gargled under the weight of the ODST specialist. Grant's hand slowly made way for his boot-knife, ironically not located in his boot. No one would suspect it, would they? ""Hey...Hey...I can get you court-marshalled for that...Or I could...""
Without warning, he brought his blade up quickly, injecting it into a gap between the ODST specialist's armour, on the leg that was pressed against his chest. The man, as identifiable by his voice, stumbled backwards limping away before Grant had a chance to regain control of his knife. Before he could react, putting on an action-hero style beat-down on the ODST soldiers, the butt of a firearm smacked into his face, driving him into a cold and dark abyss known as being unconscious...

>One month ago...
""Ahh...Bloody porridge inside the prison? Can we please hire someone who didn't drop out of cooking school to make us meals?"" Grant called from his cell. The charred bowl he held in his hands reeked of disappointment and failure whilst a gloopy substance someone categorised with food begged to be indulged. It was a sad time. Here, he could be, roaming free in a field with butterflies and rainbows, when instead he was sitting in what was the equivalent to the testicle-sweat of the UNSC Fleet.
There used to be a room-mate for Grant, but he was either released or moved to another cell for the rebel apparently making jokes about rape...Who knew that his jokes sounded like legitimate threats to other prisoners? Grant wasn't the strongest lad in the block, nor the prison at all. He was like the scrawny guy who gets by slipping between the big lads and hitting them from behind. But in all honesty, Grant did not like fighting in the prison at all. It felt wrong, much like what half of his insurgent actions were like to himself. And now, he was sitting in an orbital prison, without even a window view of the world outside.
Could you really call it outside? It was more of an emptiness right? The vacuum of space being some sort of...Y'know what, this was getting far too deep and annoying for someone of the likes of Grant. Sure, he was an extremely intelligent lad, but Grant wasn't known for sitting on his arse and thinking too much. He was more of a reactions-kinda guy? Or something like that. Usually distance was hi [/INST] s ally in combat, but he wasn't going to be seeing anymore of that in a while.
Until the gate to his own cell opened, and two guards, accompanying a smartly dressed man, looked at him. They were silent at first, staring at the peculiar man. He did not look anything like the other people in the prison cells. He was tall, skinnier, though not lean, and very well presented, save for a small stubble and ruffled hair. The two met eyes, in a non-romantic way, and shared thoughts, both questioning one another inside another.
""Hello, Grant...I'd like to share a proposition for you...""

>Location: Freelancer Facility
>Present day...

The fighting had commenced, and immediately, Grant dove for cover at the furthest distance he could gain. It was time for a little surveying. He brandished his new armour, with his new alias, and his shiny new weaponry. Holstered onto his back, a M6C and M6MP, both kitted with custom wrist grips, remained on guard for use. His hands held a very modified DMR, with the ability to praise attachment modification and ammo types. He scanned the battlefield ahead, despite it being a scenario.
It was littered with moving bodies. Both attacking the bots and being thrown about like children's toys. It was humorous, to say the least, but he knew that he'd be in the same situation if he did not think this through. He noticed the bots all fighting differently, depending on who they fought. Turns out they had similar thoughts, or programming in this case, as to Iowa. He knew what they were doing, though. Adapting to the similar military or brute force tactics. Well, to combat someone who learns your strategies, you'd have to keep changing your own one. Iowa was blessed to know he could deal some damage with this in mind.
Before he began to raise up to new heights, a voice called out in his helmet, causing him to jump and almost lose his balance from where he stood statically. It came as a surprise to him, definitely.
""Agent Iowa, that location is already occupied. However, there are many other points to gain a marksmanship position from."" He looked around him, checking it wasn't just another voice near him. But Iowa knew this sounded differently, much like the...It was the artificial intelligence that he was promised back at the Prison and through his beginning days as a Freelancer. And now, he was fighting alongside all of these other individuals, all with their own additions and AIs to put to use. ""Your silence is not comforting, Agent Iowa. Allow me to stimulate your senses, perhaps now you won't be so hesitant.""
""Bah, I am not prepared for a voice in my head..."" Iowa called to himself. He had to admit, the UNSC had some really interesting gear to play around with. He wished he stuck around stealing their stuff more often to get this for his friends of the past. ""Alright...Alright...So I just got...A weird feeling...But I guess I know what you mean...Lemme just study them for a sec'.""
Iowa's eyes darted between the areas of the training zone, looking between the robots to see weaknesses. It seemed that they were vulnerable to heavy, continuous punishment, as well as single, hard-hitting rounds from large weapons. But he didn't have large weaponry. However, the first, he did have access to rapid fire. He upholstered his M6MP, and quickly snapped on the wrist guard. It tightened itself around his armour, remaining in his hands. Wonderful fit, and wonderful trigger size. It fitted like a glove...A glove that was filled with dangerous projectiles...
He threw himself over the wall he hid behind, moving around carefully to find a singled out robot. It was easy to start from the rim and make his way inside where the heavy resistance would be. And just as his luck, the AI in his mind spotted it.
""I forgot to add...My name is Sigma, your advanced AI assigned to you specifically by the Director. I like long walks on the beach and country music...""
""Woah woah woah...Introductions later, blippy...And please tell me you were joking about the last one..."" His AI responded quickly, as Sigma gave him a gentle shock.
""I was programmed to understand humour, quite significantly. Apparently it would suit your level of socialising, if your reports show up clear enough.""
""Great...You have access to my reports..."" He began to take strides forward, running towards the larger bot ahead of him. It had a small gap underneath its raised legs, as he slid down onto his knees, holding down the trigger on his weapon as he aimed it skywards. The bullets sprayed into the underside, before he halted on the opposite side of the bot. From here, he began unloading at the head of the bot, providing heavy and repetitive punishment until both he had to reload and the bot gave in to the pressure. Luckily, both happened at the same time. ""Aha! Looks like your programme was just...Delete-""
Before he could finish his terrible excuse for a joke, a fist smacked him in the side, sending him sliding along the floor towards a group of other Freelancers. During his epiphany of sliding amongst the unclear floor of nuts and bolts, he came to realise that this was instant karma for the crimes he had made for the laws of humour and decent comedy...Eventually, he came to a stop when he swiped one of the Freelancer's off of their feet in a collision. </s>"
316,"<s>[INST] Washington chuckled. ""Wash is fine.""
Washington watched Ohio taking apart the droids it was like watching an expert engineer taking apart a car, so thorough.
""Problem is i'm much more close quarters with my rifle here, i'll show you"".
Roaring in a battle cry he charged into the nearest robot stabbing the robot as hard as he could in the chest. The bayonet piercing the robot's chest and opening him as easily as a can opener. The bot grabbed for him wildly as Washington pulled the trigger filling it full of led. It arms went limp just as Washington reached the end of his mag. Grabbing his M363 he fired it at the bots moving towards California taking out two and clearing the way for him.
""Domo arigato, bitch."" His sudden lapse of concentration rewarded him with a punch to the face knocking him off his feet and back onto the floor. ""No more mister nice guy then"".
Pulling out his M363 he fire it at the chest of the robot who had punched him in the face. Kicking the offending bot in the chest it stumbled backwards over some rubble as Washington rolled out of the way. Standing up he saw the bot recovering from the kick. Walking away from the robot he pressed the red button on the side of his M363 the bomb detonated blowing the robots torso clean off. ""I'm going to call you the sticky launcher, not the best name but it's better then the M363 Remote Projectile Detonator.""
As he was just getting to know his knew sticky buddy a body came flying out of nowhere sweeping him off his feet and sending him crashing to the floor. ""Woah, bit yo gun ho there dude.""
Standing up Washington surveyed the battlefield, he could only see a few of these robots left. A loud horn could be heard over the gunfire and agents shouts. The robots shut down and stood to attention on the spot. The Directors voice then sounded over the inte [/INST] rcom.
""Alright Agents that enough, You are dismissed for today. Washington you are needed in the medical bay, as of this moment your armour abilities are now activated. Ensure you follow the rules any deviation will be punished harshly! Apart from this you are free to explore the installation, go to your room or mingle with the other agents. It's entirely up to you. However you will have a mission coming up soon so be prepared to move at a moments notice"".
Washington reloaded his AR and placed it on the magnetic grip on his back. He did the same with his newly named sticky launcher which he placed instead on the back of his torso. ""Well that was a bit nuts right? Those bots always manage to surprise me with their resilience to fire. Makes you wonder why they don't use them instead right?""
Washington did a double take. ""Wait you all have A.I.? What the hell all you guys get the bells and whistles and i'm standing here with my dick in my hand looking like a jackass. Hope I get the good end of the stick with these A.I.s.""
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leaving the training field he headed up to the medical bay. Before he was able to enter a female nurse said he would need to remove his armour and wear a surgical gown. ""Already trying to get me out of my clothes cheeky girl"".
His crude humor was met with silence. Feeling awkward he took the gown and got changed into it. Once he was changed he was told to lie down on a table. Washington never did like surgery rooms and he imagined that this would not be a pleasant experience. A mask was lowered round his face as surgeon gathered around him, after a few second he slept into unconsciousness and the surgeons began their work...... </s>"
317,"<s>[INST] The butt of Montana's shotgun met the face of another robot.""Will you just die all ready!"" he exclaimed as the lights in the machine finally sputtered off "",About damn time, no game over today."" He zigged and zag to cover to get his bearings as several other bots focused their attention on him.
""The fight grows weary, eliminate them,"" a low gravely voice stated.
""Not now Omega I'm busy and I'm working on it,"" Montana replied back peaking over the wall only to duck when a shot bouced off the barrier.
""All right then how about a bit of [/INST] a bang,"" he said unstrapping a grenade and quickly jumping up and tossing it. Time seem to briefly stop as the bots looked at the grenade and Montana celebrated early. His celebration lasted only shortly as the grenade sailed over the bots to beyond an unoccupied barrier.

""That throws trajectory was pathetic,"" Omega stated to which Montana cursed at before finding new cover. The battle ended shortly after.
""Damn wanted to crush some more tin cans,"" Montana said with disappointed exiting the simulation room with the other freelancers. </s>"
318,"<s>[INST] It was all a blur after he got thrown through the wall, his rifle tumbling out of his hands as he clutched his head. He looked up to the robot walking towards him, backing up slowly as he reached for his BMR. As the robot got closer Delta looked over to his left, shaking his head. ""I would put your hands up.""
""What?"" Maine got confused, stopping his motion as his hands were up near his face now. Suddenly another freelancer rushed in, knocking over the robot going for him and throwing him his rifle, which he caught. Huh, so the freelancer wasn't totally worthless after all. However, he did see that he was getting pinballed between two robots.
As soon as he raised his rifle to fire, another freelancer, Washington, shot the two surrounding California. Well... shit. Now there were no robots. Maine got up, dusting himself off as he looked around to address the situation.
""Behind you."" was all Maine heard from Delta as he turned around, practically getting slide tackled by agent Iowa. Maine slipped forward, falling chest first into the ground as he looked up to what shoved Iowa at him. Maine rapidly flipped his trigger finger, busting all the remaining bullets in his clip into the chest of the robot in mere seconds, scrap metal flying everywhere as the robot crumpled in a heap, several bullets speeding into god only knows where.
""Watch it, Freelancer."" Maine said coldly, getting up once again and sticking his rifle to the magnet on his back as he watched all the robots shut themselves off. Keeping all his equipment on, he marched without a word out of the training room and straight to the firing range, wherever that may be. He wanted to know what the scores on the leaderboard were, but those didn't seem to be posted yet. He wanted to train with his new equipment in [/INST] the mean time, not so much caring for the other agents at the moment.
""Agent Maine, it seems as though your equipment is online and fully functional. This should help us in spotting targets in smoke, through walls, at far distances, as well as predict enemy movement for more precise shots."" Delta explained, standing on his shoulder like usual.
""I got it Delta. Let's practice with the equipment and test it out.""
""Alright. Do you think you should converse with the other agents first?""
""Why would I do that?""
""Well you are a part of a squad and should be working together. Teamwork will help you perform missions more efficiently and help performance levels.""
""I don't trust half those guys, and it's not like idol conversation will do much. I'm used to working on my own. Besides, I'm pretty sure half these assholes were rebels and insurgents, prisoners of war let out to fight here. My job as ODST was to assassinate, capture, do surveillance on guys like that.""
""Either way, agent Maine, basic conversation won't hurt.""
""Fine... after training. Maybe."" Maine grumbled, giving in to the AI. It seemed Delta was more sociable than he was, borededing on caring. Very talkative too. But he was right... getting to know his allies would help. Even if Maine thought he was better than half the people here. The one did help him. At the very least gaining some knowledge might have benefits in the future.
At the firing range, agent Maine layer down, setting up his tripod as he looked through the scope of his rifle. Targets appeared in the distance, human shaped ones, standing very far away as they started to move in random patterns at varying speeds.
""Tactical visor online, scanning targets... fire when ready Agent Maine.""
After that, the only sounds that were heard were gun shots. </s>"
319,"<s>[INST] As all the Freelancers started to leave the training area, Utah, on the other hand went unnoticed inside a tall building within the designated space.
“What was the point of this, Agent Utah? We haven’t even fired a single shot.”
Zeta asked in a low gravelly voice as Utah looked through her DMR’s scope.
“I want to know what I’m dealing with, since I don’t just want to get tangled up in the mix; besides, sneaking around is also something we’re bound to do anyway.”
“And what are we dealing with, Agent Utah?”
“Based on my experience… A bunch of fuckups given suits, AI, weapons, and armor thrown into a group and expected to work together; nothing like the ODSTs I used to work with.”
Zeta then looked at her in his yellow floating form as Utah carefully surveyed each and every freelancer, not once taking her eyes off the scope.
“Do you think we’ll have any fun with them instead of these emotionless robots?”
Utah looked at Zeta, then tilted her head to look at the exit where the Freelancers were going through.
“No… Not at all… fuckups aren’t fun, in fact they’re as fun as shit hitting the fan---which by the way isn’t fun---besides, we need them although I hate to admit it; maybe when we're on a mission in a target rich environment though.”
Her lips parted into a smirk, a giggle escaping from inside he [/INST] r helmet. She lifted her DMR over her shoulder with one hand, allowing the other to hang off the side.
“You’re a ""Fuckup"" yourself, Agent Utah.”
She looked at Zeta and said, “Well better being fucked up than staying a virgin, am I right?”
Zeta took a pause as he processed what he had just heard.
“Your sense of humor according to my analytics program is, quote, as stale as a five week- old loaf of moldy bread, end quote.”
“Well damn, no need to be a stinker about it.”
Zeta then made the better decision of shutting himself down, leaving Utah with no one to talk to.
“Am I right, Zeta? Eh, Eh? Zeta?.... Are you… “Turned Off”?”
Utah waited for a moment, then she decided to crack off another one of her genius puns.
“Fucking rude, I’m sexy aren’t I?”
Utah laughed at herself for a while, reconsidered her poor life choices, then let out a deep sigh. “I’m a natural… I should get the hell out of here now though.” She then proceeded towards the exit of the training area.
“Let’s shake hands and make friends, shall we?”
She then proceeded to turn Zeta on again, her personality falling into a serious mind set, her demeanor completely changed.
“Have you stopped with your-“
Before Zeta could finish his sentence, Utah already knew what he was going to say.
“No more puns… We’re going to meet our new compatriots.” </s>"
320,"<s>[INST] The battle began to sputter to a stop around Ohio, that didn't stop her fellow agents from packing in as much uncoordinated and clumsy 'team work' as possible. Ohio's smile was hidden behind her opaque visor, she had missed working as part of a team. It had been quite some time since she had last worked with people she wasn't secretly ordered to kill or betray. It was likely she would betray them anyways as soon as she had an ulterior motive but for now they were all relatively on the same side. The simulation ended with a summons for Washington, from what she would gather he did not have an A.I. and it was likely he was getting one. She silently wished him luck as she watched him go.
""Hey Gamma,"" She said summoning the A.I. as she began to exit the field, ""They said something about abilities, they're not talking about what you A.I.s do., are they?""
""No, they have activated the special abilities unique to each set of Freelancer armor. You were informed of this, you have active camouflage technology built into your suit. Furthermore, my abilities are active at all times, should you choose to use them."" The small figure on her shoulder informed her.
""Well I won't be."" She snapped, her tone defensive and tight. ""It's nothing personal but for right now I think its better that I don't. Invisibility, right, I used something like this a few years ago on a mission, I hope they've improved the tech. It didn't work well back then, the mission came real close to going south. Command really thought I was a gonner.""
""Obviously you survived and succeeded, your record indicates that you've never failed a mission. I have a feeling that even the extended record I was allowed to download, there is still much I am missing."" Even through that robotic voice it was clear he was fishing for information.
Ohio sighed, ""I've worked for a lot of different people Gamma, that's the thing about not settling in with a team or in a division, you get shifted and you get used a lot. Not only is compiling all that information from different sources a logistical nightmare, some of it can never go on any record. My assignments have also been a hodgepodge of all sorts of things, it wouldn't be much of a coherent record anyway."" Ohio had wandered her way into some sort of observatory room that over looked the various training rooms, a control panel glowed softly on the other side of the room. It seemed as if the agents had some ability to control the simulations but as the director and the counselor were not here it was likely they had their own master control center. ""My instincts are telling me to start looking into the other agents but this isn't one of my missions and we're using code names for a reason. I'd be willing to bet [/INST] there's a lot more to most of these people than meets the eye. You don't end up in a program like this unless you really want to be or you really had no choice.""
Gamma hesitated for a moment before resuming his robotic monotone, ""Agent Ohio if you truly wish to find information I maybe of some assistance. I haven't been completely honest in my abilities, I have some ability to posses technology. I could find information in the computer systems on board if you upload my program. I trust you won't say anything to the director?""
""You don't trust me,"" She scoffed, ""You just already know I'm not going to say anything."" She paused for a moment, standing at a window over looking a shooting range where one of the other agents was already practicing. ""So you could like posses a tank and use it by yourself?""
""Yes, that is one application.""
""Or take over a computer system and pretend to not be an A.I.""
""That would also be possible.""
""Good to know, we'll keep that to ourselves. I don't think now is the time to start sniffing out the others skeletons, not till mine are well buried."" She said quietly, her tone more cold and stiff, ""We are a better match than I even anticipated, until we betray each other that is.""
Gamma acted as taken aback as a glitchy hologram could, ""Ohio believe me when I say-""
""Cut the crap, it's who we both are, we're on the same side now but as soon as we want different things we won't be. Neither of us are sacrificers, we just take things and take things until we get caught or get what we want.""
""For a liar agent Ohio, you tell the truth more often than one would think."" He waited a moment for a response but Ohio said nothing and after another moment of silence he asked, ""If I may ask Agent Ohio, which group of freelancers are you in, those with no choice or those who made the choice?""
Agent Ohio sighed as if searching for an answer, ""When someone in my line of work receives a message saying they don't have any missions for the foreseeable future along with a suggestion to join a program like this you do what they want. Its a question of loyalty. I don't suppose you have any knowledge of the book Catch 22, do you?"" She didn't wait for a response, ""Basically the out come I want is to live but the only way I can do that is by joining a program that will likely kill me, the point is I can't win."" Gamma's processors seemed to be chewing on that so he didn't respond, Ohio continued watching Agent Maine, ""Good shot that one, doubt he's got any people skills, he's actively not socializing.""
""Agent Ohio I can't help but see the hypocrisy in that assumption."" Gamma commented plainly. Ohio rolled her eyes inside her helmet and remained silent because the stupid little robot thing was right. </s>"
321,"<s>[INST] California grinned as he heard the exercise was now over, watching the rest of the robots power down. California's immediate response was to take of his helmet, letting his beard spring out and flicking his hair back. ""Woo!"" He exclaimed in exasperation. ""Damn, that was some good exercise!"" The freelancer commented. He rolled his shoulders as he walked out, rubbing his chin from the blow from the robot. Chi finally showed her form to California, sitting on his shoulder. Chi looked like a young girl with long hair, completely red and slightly see through.
""That looked like it hurt?"" Chi noted, looking at California.
""Hmm... well, not as much as it should've. Before the Project, that would have knocked me out cold."" He explained. ""Did you have something to do with that?"" California inquired. The girl puzzled for a bit.
""Well, kinda. I mean, you're like... a super soldier now so you've got the biological augmentations and the armour isn't made out of putty either, that's some hard metal you got encasing yourself. The AI explained. It seemed that California's AI did not share the common 'professional and toneless' dialect most other AI possessed. ""But I do help you out too. I'm told I give you... uhm... adrenaline, yeah! And that hypes you up and, so says my data, can numb some pain as well.""
""Yeah, adrenaline does that."" He replied as he walked out of the training field. He too [/INST] k a good look at his new teammates. All by the books military hardasses to him. They'd all probably wanna stick to 'plans' and wouldn't enjoy his passion for 'combat improvisation' as he likes to call it.
""What? You don't like them?""
""Did you just tell what I was... nevermind. I'm not gonna ask questions about what I don't get. And no, Chi. It's not that I don't like them. They're all capable and probably just a bit of time before warming up to one another... but they'll probably not like me. I've been told I'm... reckless..."" California admitted.
""Yeah... your files maaaaay have mentioned that."" Chi giggled. Arthur shrugged.
""Eh, whatever."" California laughed. He saw a freelancer that he... didn't see on the field. Weird... he saw everyone that participated... but not this one (). ""Chi, who's that lady?""
""I dunno, I only have data on you. I think she's Zeta's Freelancer. But that's all I know. The AI's aren't allowed to talk to each other anymore."" Chi said sadly.
""Huh, seems counter productive to do that... you bothered by it?"" Cali asked. Chi merely nodded. ""Huh, fuck it, I'ma talk to her."" He said to himself before jogging up and waving his hand. ""Yo! Recon armour!"" He called out, using the only item of description he could recognize. ""You, uhh, didn't get the memo? There was a training thing the Director ordered?"" He asked, clutching his helmet between his arm and chest. </s>"

""Indeed we shall see,"" the AI ended the conversation.
""You are just a ray of sunshine,"" Montana grumbled as he moved down the corridor "",Well at least th [/INST] e one thing I can credit you with Omega is that you're not the chatty type."" When he didn't get a response Montana decided to best try and converse with one of the other freelancers. He decided to roam around until he just happened to bump into one of his teammates.

“Zeta, who’s that?”
“Data is insufficient…”
Utah then glanced over her shoulder to see the other freelancer, Iowa , still inside the Training area making his way to the exit.
“What about him?”
“Data is insufficient…”
“Well aren’t you helpful?... Ah fuck it I’ll just talk to ‘em; after that, let’s see if this place has a kill-house.”
Utah’s sarcasm didn’t seem to bother Zeta. Zeta was more of the reserved type of A [/INST] I, which included not being very chatty, but when it came down to it, Utah and Zeta made a good match.
“Uh… Yeah, I heard, I was just up there…”
Utah pointed at her previous position with her free hand, while shouldering her DMR with the other. She proceeded to walk as she continued in conversation with California.
“It was a good place to watch the action from…”
Her words drooped with sarcasm, a stark contrast to her serious behavior no more than a few moments ago.
Brushing off her previous statement, she extended a hand promptly towards California, by way of greeting.
“Name’s Utah by the way, not ‘Recon Armour’.” </s>"
324,"<s>[INST] Washington woke up in his room, feeling disorientated and groggy. Getting up he massaged his pounding head. As he got up he noticed a movement on the end of his bed. Reaching for his gun he trained it on the end of his bed. ""Come out, or you're gonna be in a lot of pain"" A small blue replica of himself appeared. It had exactly the same armour on as he had but was no larger than a Pint glass.
""Hey there, sorry I didn't mean to scare you. My name is Epsilon.""
Washington's eye were wide open as the blue man disappeared and reappeared on his shoulder.
""The Director implanted me inside a small chip located at the back of your head. You can if you wish remove me whenever you want. However the Director says that's a bad idea. It wont hurt your or anything, it's just The Director wants us in your heads all the time. He also had them activate your suits ability. You my friend have the ability of teleportation. You can move yourself or objects through spaces. It works in about a one mile radius. Please be aware that you cannot teleport big objects or more than one person if you try more than one you might end up leaving stuff behind. Like legs or internal organs.""
Washington smirked as he put his armour back on. ""Noted Epsilon. Tell you what buddy I think we're going to get along just fine.""
""Hey Epsilon? Is my head supposed to hurt this much? Feels like someones pounding away at my helmet with a sledgehammer"". Stumbling he made his way out of his room. A few staff moved out of the way as Washington bumped shoulders with them. ""Sorry""
Epsilon spoke in a cheerful tone female tone. ""Don't worry there pal, the pain is just your subconscious and mine becoming one. It's going to allows you to recall a lot of memories that your brain normally can't however-"" An ear splitting scream filled his ear, Washingt [/INST] on crashed through the door of the Canteen knocking over a bin as he cried out in pain. The noise stopped as suddenly as it had started. His ear ringing, Washington slowly and painfully got to his feet.
""Epsilon? You there buddy?"" A voice suddenly filled his head.
""But sir you have no idea what effects this will have on the A.I.. The A.I. was entrusted to you. It was going to help you with your research.""
Washington recognised the next voice, it belonged to the Director. ""That is right Corporal it was entrusted to me. Not you, not him. Me! You do well to know your place. Prepare the Architect. I've already had project freelancer accepted by the board of directors. I want the A.I. ready.""
Then there was silence. Washington was now lying against the wall of the canteen. Epsilon appeared. ""Sorry about that Wash, had to reboot. Some kind of bug in my system. Should be gone now. Wash? You alright.""
""I just heard voices in my head""
Epsilon was silent for a moment. ""Well then I'll have you booked to see the doc-""
""I'M NOT CRAZY! What I meant to say was. I heard the director talking to someone in my head, about something called the Architect""
Epsilon was silent again however this time when she spoke her voice was full of static and her speech was slow as if every word was a mile. ""The Architect, I recognise that name for some reason. But I can't place my finger on it.""
Washington sighed. ""You don't have any fingers. It doesn't matter. As you said it was just a bug and it shouldn't happen again. Lets get something to eat."" Looking at the bin he had knocked over he pointed at the first staff member that walked in. "" Come on man pick up this mess you made!""

""Well fellas, it seems as though the mighty Director has called for are eyes and ears in the briefing room. Best not to disappoint him.""

The mission is simple; Insurgent forces have attacked the Power plant on Research planet Delta-6B, they have sabotaged and disabled the nuclear reactor and have possibly overloaded the reactors core to critical levels. Their main objective seems to be disruption of the research facility located on the planet. We are to stabiliz [/INST] e the reactor and rescue any survivors we find, eliminating any threats to the mission that may arise. There are several key characters involved in this attack:
George Relph: The Insurgents Second in command he is a deadly man who is skilled in many different martial arts.
Simmons Westford: Well known hacker. Wanted for Cyber Crimes as well as terrorism.
Finally there is Beth a Mercenary skilled with the Covenant Energy sword. She is known for using alien tech in battle and is possibly the most dangerous of the lot.
Apart from that there is a force of probably around 100 insurgents armed with various types of weaponry as well as Freelancer Armour abilities. It seems Agent Washington that your in charge of this mission. Best go up there and talk to the troops!
Washington nodded Stepping up onto the stage he motion to the agents to listen.
"" Hey, I'm agent Washington and as you've heard I'm in charge of this mission and I, Have a plan! The only way we're going to beat these guys is with team work. I think a stealthy approach is necessary with a sprinkling of distraction and chaos to make the stealthy part easier. Maine you will be Overwatch and Sniper support. Your job will be to keep an eye on our enemies positions and also ours.
We will split into two groups. Myself, Agent California, Agent Montana and Agent Ohio will head to the reactor and ensure that it is stabilized returning power to the facility and to its defences. The research facility operates a Skeleton crew of about 12 scientist who use robots similar to the ones we fought for defence and manual labour. Once power is returned we will search for the Scientist.
The rest of you will work on distracting and drawing away the enemy from the reactor. That's you Agent Iowa and Agent Utah. Once the defences are back up the robots should help out making it easier to push back the Insurgents and force them off the planet or, wipe them out.""
Taking a deep breath he looked at the agents. ""Any Questions?"" </s>"
327,"<s>[INST] After standing to his feet, staggering slightly at the action of slipping around, being tossed around by mechanical humanoids and retaliating with fire, the all clear was alarmed throughout the facility, indicating that the exercise was indeed over. He took a long, deep breath to signify his relief. As much as he enjoyed shooting large robots in the head, it didn't make sense to him. In fact, it was worth ranting about, but far too many Agents had already made way for the exit before he had a chance to find the perfect dispute partner. It was saddening slightly. Iowa was quickly left as one of the, if not the, last agents still lurking around waiting for something to do.
They'd all left quickly, and so, he stood there. He wasn't sure of what to do, but as he began to walk slowly towards the exit, he began to talk aloud to himself. It was not a loud yell, more like a quiet ramble to himself. Though many could mistake it for a conversation with his AI, it wasn't to begin with. Iowa found comfort in talking to himself sometimes, as it allowed him to hear what he sounded like. If he knew what he sounded like, he could judge whether or not his idea sounded like absolute shit or like a cake-walk.
""I mean...Robots...Fucking, large and inhumane robots. Why train against robots when we're an Anti-Terrorist sorta unit? We fight against individuals with individual skills. Sure, a robot can adapt to my own fighting style, or anyone's really, but a human has their own style. And someone with their own style is used to an advantage. And we are less likely to face someone who literally tanks around like a Mantis Bipedal Mech than a man who has a nuclear detonation trigger in his fingertips.""
His AI, Sigma, was quick to intervene. It was good at doing that, giving him that extra bit of information and talking ethic to keep him going from becoming a solitary, anxious young man.
""Agent Iowa, might I inform you of your more...outcastish behaviour? You don't look comfortable. Perhaps I should introduce you to the department of relaxation. Or possibly a comrade to talk to? I believe that you should get to know your working partners as soon as po-""
""If they wanted to get to know me, they would've walked up to me to start it. Everyone knows I'm terrible at getting straight into the talking."" He walked along, DMR hooked onto his back and handguns onto his leg holsters. He was liking the new armour, quickly. ""And what about pretty-boy Agent Washington? Director calls him in...I bet he's some prodigy to the team, or something...""
His mumble was low, and moderate. If there was one thing Iowa had picked up about his opinions of war was that heroes weren't something that could be given so easily. If the director was going to praise a single, capital-state named agent and expect everyone to look up towards them as a war-hero, then Iowa might as well be sticking his head up Wash's ass. A hero was a target in the big-game that was war, and having such a notoriety from both your enemies and friends was just a set-up for targeting or betrayal.Sure, he was more skilled than Iowa. Everyone was probably more skilled than Iowa. All of them had elite military training, or at least most [/INST] of them. And those who didn't fought in major, suicidal situations on a weekly basis to conflict the threats of terrorists, insurrectionists and the almighty Covenant. Iowa, on the other hand, was just a boy brought up by a rebellious group. It was only in the last few weeks of their existence that had Iowa picked up a familiarity with conventional tactics, but they only led to the critical defeat that had Iowa captured in the first place. It was still a mystery why someone of his background, skill, ability and mindset was selected for such an important organisation and project.
He continued to walk, turning his head slightly to the small pairs of joyous, serious, jokey and regular agents converse between one another. No one was free, or not engaged in a conversation. Perfect reason to repel Iowa from his own introduction. None of these people wanted to know him, did they?
>The briefing room...


He slid in as one of the last ones to enter the room. Luckily, the meeting hadn't started. It wasn't overly crowded, as a small crew had been handpicked for this mission. It was awkward, to some extent. Iowa found himself in a room of people he'd accidentally knocked over during the training exercise. Perhaps they made more use of their time than Iowa had. But at the front, of course, was the Director's little angel, Washington. He heard his introduction. And of course...He was the team leader. It was inevitable, but he had to go along with it. There wasn't any options for making enemies within his only chance of survival.
Iowa folded his arms and tucked himself at the back of the pack, listening to his words. Insurgents...And what he'd be doing. Obviously, the distraction would be up to him. But he'd have to make an agreement with whoever Utah was. Agent Utah could be someone of his type, seeing as they'd been selected to run a task that naturally screams unconventional distractions. Plus, someone who likes to blow stuff up for the sake of catching attention is always a good person. Washington asked if there were any questions, and quickly, Iowa was the first to respond.
""Yeah, I have a few...First of all, can we have some information on who these insurgents are, as an organisation? I'd rather know who we're killing than being blindly asked to fire at someone. Secondly, a distraction? You want me to make a noise? Make an explosion? Make a trap? Do a lil' switcheroo with someone's lunch? Dress up as a woman and seduce them like a bad film? I'd prefer the second and third option, or am I being limited? And thirdly...Do we all get a chance at playing Leader or is it always a Follow Mr. Washing Machine from now on?""
Humour had been used to cover up some of his concerns. If they weren't going to do the distraction in a proper way, something he knew he was an expert in, and possibly Utah was as well if he knew who they were, then it might as well not happen. They couldn't cause too much damage, but they couldn't cause too little. More to the point, who were they going to shoot? Iowa had always had concerns about hunting insurrectionists. One day...One day they'd be going after who he had been brought up within. He needed to make sure...He needed to make sure... </s>"
328,"<s>[INST] Utah was going to carry the conversation with California, but before she could continue her introduction, she was interrupted by the Director’s announcement. She made her way towards the briefing room only to find it full of Freelancers. Glancing around the room, she scanned the other Freelancers and their armor, while the words of the Director rang out throughout the place. They were easy to understand and fairly simple, and the objectives were pretty straightforward. She looked at Washington stride to the front and deliver his announcement of leadership.
Utah wasn’t one to question authority, but she rolled her eyes at Washington, someone who couldn’t even keep up with the training bots back in the sim. He was reckless and stubborn. She questioned his leadership ability but in the end the plan sounded good, furthermore, she didn’t care too much about her having a partner. Her only concern was the means of distraction, which, if too heavy was sure to bring all manner of hell upon them, and if it was too light it wouldn’t bring much attention either.
She looked at the rest of her teammates and suddenly it dawned on her. T [/INST] hese people weren’t ODST, these people weren’t even professional soldiers; she didn’t know whether they were the “crème de la crème” or some bums the Freelancer program picked up. Suddenly, her concerns became broader :what if the other Freelancers fail? What if her partner wasn’t up to scratch? What if-
Her thoughts were cut short as Iowa started up some commotion about Washington being the oh-so-glorified leader. She didn’t know this was her partner, all she knew was that this was the agent that was mumbling to himself leaving the training area. She wondered why he was so adamant with knowing who they were going to fight, wasn’t this team just a ragtag bunch of people sent to do missions without any raised questions?

“Hey Washington,” Utah began. “What’s our plan B when things go wrong? I mean, I know we’re all “badasses” at what we do, but I think some of us are familiar with what happens when you get your dick all caught up. That’s a lot of responsibility and money.”
she delivered the cringy contraceptive joke with the tone of mocking sarcasm right after Iowa gave Washington the affectionate nickname washing machine. </s>"
329,"<s>[INST] Maine had left the training room when Delta informed him that there would be a meeting for their first mission. He wondered what kind of missions they would be assigned to, although he doubted they would be solo ODST mission drops like he would do prior. No, it seemed like they would do a larger scale tactical operation.
The director didn't have much to say, and that left Delta with giving him the mission briefing. Although slightly different from the others, because of his AI specifically given the information, he knew everything that he needed to know.
""Sounds simple enough. Looks like they have a pretty good arsenal coming with them. A second in command, a hacker, and a specialized soldier. I'll look out for them on the mission, take a shot and kill them if I can.""
""That would be most wise, agent Maine. But remember, those high value targets will be heavily guardered. You will have to catch them off guard. The hacker will most likely be hiding in one of the buildings, making it tougher to get to him. Taking out those key figures will surely sway the tide of the battle, however.""
""Affirmative Delta. Anything else I should know?""
""It looks like that Washington fellow is leading the charge I suppose.""
""I guess that had to choose someone. I should probably listen to what he has to say.""
The plan seemed pretty simplistic, no overly complicated strategies or tactics in mind. He didn't expect there to be, they all barely knew each other. He would be overwatch, which he expected to be right from the start. He wondered where he would be posted up at, whether that would be from the sky, a higher part of the reactor, or some distance away higher up. Once he knew the location it didn't matter too much, his ehanced vision and sniper rifle would help him take care [/INST] of the rest.
Hopefully the others could take care of their jobs, and Maine didn't have to go through five clips saving people and killing ones that they couldn't. Making sure he knew all of the enemy movements, spotted them out, etc. Maine would make their lives easier, but it was up to them to complete the task.
Agent Maine shook his head when two people decided to speak up, talking this and that and just being disrespectful assholes. That was no way to talk to leadership, and if they were in the military they would know this. Smart ass remarks and whining got you nowhere.
""The man meant questions for the good of the order, not bitching and whining from the peanut gallery. If you're asking for how you should do your job and what you should do when things go wrong, obviously you're not competent enough to do your job and do it right. You are supposed to be elite soldiers, and the job for you two is a distraction. The easiest job. If between the two of you, you both don't have enough brain cells to complete your task by yourselves and stop your bitching, I feel sorry. We don't need to know the whole mantra for our enemy. We were assigned a mission, and we carry out the mission. I don't care if the other guys are a charity group. You chose to be here one way or another, so you are expected to do what your commanding officer asks and not question them. You are a soldier.
As for leadership, grow up. It's not you guys, it's him. They picked him for a reason. Obviously you too are not competent enough to lead yourselves, let alone a team. You are supposed to be the best of the best... start acting like it, not like a bunch of teenage girls. Now unless you have any useful questions, stop getting your damn feelings hurt and just worry about doing your job right."" </s>"
330,"<s>[INST] Before Washington had the chance to even pick up on his words, someone else began to question him, though in a different fashion as to what Iowa had picked. He presumed this were to be someone from the 'Front' team that went with Washington, but he could be wrong. Her tone was a lot more mocking than Iowa's, whilst he was trying to make a joke out of real concerns he had, she was a little more passive-aggression towards the tone. And that, was where Mr. Perfect spoke up.
His voice was a lot deeper, gruff and almost sinister than Iowa's medium pitched tone. However, it seemed that the woman's remark had changed the true intention and tone behind Iowa's questionings. And so, this man, began to speak up. He rambled on about how their job was the easiest, how they weren't being good soldiers...Who the hell did this guy think he was? More to the point, did he even know anything about the military? Sure enough, Iowa hadn't come from any formal military background, in fact he was the opposition to the military for a great deal of his life, but even then he knew that they weren't like this. All 'Do-exactly-as-you-are-told'...That'd be illogical and make plenty of room for mistakes.
Iowa looked over to him; he spoke in a tone that was not snobbish, nor too aggressive. It was an informative way of speaking. However, knowing this person from how he'd reacted to what he said earlier, he'd take it the wrong way and probably use his sniper to get what the pretty-little marksman wanted. It wasn't too loud, allowing Washington to continue.
""Uhm...First of all...Those were serious questions. I'm not sure if you've ever heard of humour? A lot of the people here use it to make the best out of the moments. Those were very serious questions. I'm concerned about how we're going to execute this mission. Even the best of soldiers ask questions, otherwise it's all improvisatio [/INST] n. You gotta know how to do it right to avoid less complications. If you were a soldier, you'd know that plenty of their personnel ask questions during briefings, otherwise we might as well be tossed into the lion's pit with a stick and told to achieve world domination. And to get information on who we are fighting, well apart from having an understanding on insurgents, it's better to know your enemy than to not know them...Besides, I have personal reasons.""
He looked around, half-listening to Wash's reaction towards the woman who spoke up. He had to give Washington credit, he had a bunch of arseholes like himself and this Perfect and Solitary marksman. Typical group of misfits all thrown into the wolf pack, Iowa being with them as one of the misfits.
""And I didn't know you decided on the difficulty of each task...But it doesn't matter if it is the easiest. Every role is important, so nothing needs to be prioritised over another if you want it to go how Washing Machine wants it to go. And I'm doing that job, along with whoever, so why should it concern you on whether I want to find out how to do it? Aren't you already doing something more difficult and important? I have enough brain-cells to ask how our leader wants it, not how you want it to go. And if you want to give Washington that leadership, perhaps you should let him answer the questions I directed to him, not you, all questions that I genuinely want to know. I'm sorry if I don't function like the Best-of-the-Best Elite whatever like you do, but that's how life works. I'm not going to be the same as you, so...Let me get my answers, and then the issue is resolved. No further things to debate about. Let me get what Washington wants me to know, then it's bye bye to this conversation, because any Elite Soldier wants to get along with his team, not intervene in something that wasn't involving them..."" </s>"
331,"<s>[INST] Washington was taken aback at all of the question. As he was about to answer he begun to hear whispering in his ear it sounded like the councilor. ""Director the unit is failing, you're pushing it too hard!"" Than he heard the Director ""Quiet the unit can take it! Push it harder!""
Washington was silent for a while as the voices left his ear. ""Uh. Listen here guys, rank doesn't mean shit here. No matter who you may have been on the outside in here we're all the same. Except maybe right now. The Director has put me in charge here so I guess at the moment I am your commanding officer.""
Washington left the stage and pulled up a holo map that appeared in front of him. ""Now from what Epsilon has filled me in on this place has been working on some kind of experimental power source. Something they gained during the war covenant tech probably. The people causing the distractions can do this in whatever means they wish, you're job is to create plenty of noise and act as a distraction so we can move in and secure the scientist. I myself will deal with the reactor and I expect the two with me to provide security.""
The Holo map showed a large compound with two large steam vents behind the vents is a large building with one entrance. Washington pointed to the large building. ""This is where we need to go. Our overwatch can use th [/INST] e vents for a better view and for some good cover too, there are walkways along the very top for maintenance. The facility goes deep underground so expect my crew to drop off the radar when we go into them.""
After Washington had explained the layout he turned to the question. ""If shit hits the fan I expect you all man up and use your new armour. Remember we have the advantage they don't have we're well trained, in expensive spartan class armour with enhancements and we all have are A.I. to help us with the fight. As for who these insurgents are? I have no idea, possibly people trying to cause trouble for the UNSC but I have no idea. Ask the Director if he'll tell you."" Washington's voice distorted slightly as he said the last part.
Washington carried on like nothing had happened ""We'll be being dropped in by air using our armours lock in to survive the fall, we will than split off from the distraction team and wait for them to launch their attack and than move into the building to search for the scientists. Over watch you'll be dropping in with a stealth chute."" Washington sent the Stealth chutes info to Maine. The stealth chute was essentially a stealth parachute that allowed the individual to get where they needed to get quickly and with no detection. ""As for who get's leader next? Search me. Any more question?"" </s>"
332,"<s>[INST] Now in the briefing room, Montana listened to the first operation that they would be heading out on. At least it seemed they were all equals on this mission minus whoever was going to be calling the shots but better then dealing with someone high up who thought they were superior to everyone else.
Montana couldn't stifle the slight groan of seemingly being placed onto the stealth [/INST] group but didn't complain, might as well show that he could be flexible, even if he wanted to blow a few holes through some enemies. If he was lucky maybe he would get to snap a few necks. At least he could try to look forward to that if anything.
Once Agent Washington was done talking it was just a waiting game to see who had any more questions on what was going to be happening. </s>"
333,"<s>[INST] Utah hasn't even flinched from her original position, she tuned out the argument in the background and waited for the team lead to respond, she didn't really care of what Maine thought of her, she didn't know him, he didn't know her, and she has her own way of doing things and if that pissed him off so be it; from her experience only the CO get's to boss everyone around.
When the Iowa finished talking, she was going to repeat the questions but Wash was just a tad bit quicker, she listened carefully, apparently the back up plan was their armor augmentations, the plan was to turn the odds in their favor.
Additionally she pondered on something Wash said: that rank doesn't matter, that they're all the same no matter the outside backgro [/INST] und, she almost scoffed at the thought of it, 'these people are the same as me? Not a chance, there's no way the would know what hell I went through would they?' she pushed her thoughts aside and refocused.
There was one more question in her mind however...

""One more thing, what is everyone's designated codename? We were given them might as well use 'em.""
the way she spoke this time was more of a calm serious demeanor, Washington's reflection shone off on her bright blue visor, in her mind the mission was the most important thing, she wanted to know the names to be able to communicate effectively with her team, her weapons were ready for the job, her pouches packed with ammunition; she was going to 'make friends' later on instead. </s>"
334,"<s>[INST] ""We'll use are standard code-names for the operation. If that's all the question we'll be heading out at 19:00 so prep your gear and i'll see you there!"" Washington left the briefing to rest his aching head and clear his mind for the mission ahead.
18:00
Happy that everything was in order he looked at the drop Pelican that would be transporting them. Outfitted for high orbit drops it had many pods strapped to the sides and was almost twice the size of a regular pelican, built to drop them in then zoom out. Looking at it he remembered how much he hated Halo dropping. The gut wrenching G force and of course the crashing, that was his least favorite part of it. As he was imaging the idea of plummeting to his death the Counselor walked in, as several of the engineers stopped to salute.
""Good evening Agent Washington. How are you today? Ah. Gearing up for the mission then I see.""
Washington turned to The Counselor he wasn't a person to salute a superior, not after what he had seen in the war against the flood. Washington didn't like this man, something about the Counselor was off. He just couldn't place his finger on it. ""Good Evening to you too Counselor. I'm doing okay, not looking forward to the Halo drop. Never did trust these buckets of metal we're dropped from the sky in.
The counselor chuckled lightly, looking down at his PDA he tapped it a few times before replying. ""We've had some reports that your A.I. may be malfunctioning. Have you noticed anything irregular about it?""
Washington Said yes but what came out was. ""No sir, nothing Irregular at all.""
""Okay then, we'll keep an eye on you just in case. These A.I.s are experimental, so they may be a little buggy. It's best we squash these bugs before t [/INST] hey become a problem."" The counselor walked away and out of the shuttle bay. Washington was a loss for words.
""Epsilon, What the fuck did you just do?""
Epsilon appeared looking sheepish. ""I'm sorry Wash, I didn't want you to tell him I might be faulty, he'll rip me out of your skull and lock me away again. I don't think I could deal with being alone with it again."" Epsilons voice was full of terror now and Washington was getting quite concerned.
""Easy there Epsilon. What do you mean by alone with it? With the other A.I.s? But, you're all separated so why does it matter?""
Epsilons voice cut out and was replaced by thousands of different voice speaking in unison. ""I am the Alpha I am who was, I am what was destroyed in pain and suffering I was the First.""
Now it was Washington's turn to be afraid. The voices cut out leaving the sound of a woman crying in his head. ""Umm, Epsilon? You alright?""
The crying faded out replaced with Epsilon's voice ""Yes, why do you ask? Come on Wash, it's almost time for the mission to start. Are drones we that were sent out have submitted a report of the current location of the enemy. Beth is there she is currently guarding the perimeter a long with a couple of dozen rebels. However due to the lining of the Reactor room the drone is having trouble telling who else maybe inside the building.""
Washington was worried for his own safety now, Epsilon was having some major malfunctions and there wasn't a damn thing he could do. Pushing it aside he would confront this issue after the mission. Opening up the coms he radioed all agents heading out on the mission. ""This is Agent Washington to all Agents. The mission is a-go please make your way to the shuttle bay and prepare to leave."" </s>"
335,"<s>[INST] Utah finished prepping for the mission before all the others and was already on her way to the Pelican way before Wash even opened up Comms. Her weapons of choice were loaded and Zeta was ready to aid her in the mission.
""Zeta, have you gotten all their names yet?"" She was eager to get the mission rolling, and was now going through her final checks.
""Yes, the file has been repaired their on your HUD now."" Zeta was also eager, he wanted to have some fun.
""Be prepared Z, so [/INST] mething tells me that this mission is going to be rough.""
They finally got to the Hangar where Washington was. She stopped and saluted in normal navy fashion.

""Permission to board, sir!"" it was clean and crisp, typical of an ODST, something that hadn't changed since she left Boot. Just goes to show why she graduated with above average marks, several points higher infact, and her performance was exmplary. In her entire career there was only one blemish in her record, ONI. </s>"
336,"<s>[INST] Finally we are going, Montana stated as he made his way to the Pelican, placing his weapon on his back "",Time to crack some skulls, and take some names."" Just thinking about the mission brought him back to some of his more rugged missions he did before the program. One thing he did after a kill if he could find the body was scratch the name of the enemy into the barrel of his gun. He doubt he would have much time doing that during this mission but he could still try if there was ever a lull in the mission.
""No mercy for the wea [/INST] k,"" Omega simply stated as they reached the others, giving Washington a salute though not as crisp as agent Utah had given. So far he liked Washington but whether or not he deserved the respect of being leader was something that Montana was yet sure on and this mission was going to decide that for him among how he felt for the other members of the program.
""Good old halo drop then to start the mayhem? Always liked dropping in unannounced,"" he stated as he waited for everyone else and for the Pelican to take off once allowed on. </s>"
337,"<s>[INST] Iowa had departed from the briefing room as soon as he had the chance to. He didn't want to hang around members who might've picked up on his questions and misinterpreted their meaning or tone. Making enemies within the only organisation protecting him from the death-trial meant a lot of serious difficulties would come ahead. But some of these soldier-like aspects were very difficult to take in sometimes. Besides that, they were about to go on their first assignment, hunting down the very same people he would once fight amongst. Well, this group in particular weren't where he was from. None of the high-command individuals resembled any ranking members during the time of Iowa's presence and they would likely have handed it down to younger siblings, or cousins of Iowa. That being said, Iowa's father-like must've still been in command. But these were regular insurrectionists. Violent fighters, he knew the sort.
They were given, shortly after his departure, the call to move towards the ships and prepare for their mission's dawn. It was tense, in a way, but Iowa didn't mak [/INST] e it a 'double-time' movement. Not that he was late, but Iowa didn't run there fully. His light jog gave him time to think. Thoughts like these were being picked up by Sigma...Sigma wasn't always one to agree with what was thought.
Eventually, Iowa reached the dropship, slipping up the deployment ramp and into the garrisoned groups of Agents who were also partaking in on the mission. It was risky, and shifty, that he decided to sit closest to the least crowded seating area. Not all of the agents were on board of course, and anyone who'd want to talk to him could easily sit beside him and strike up conversation, but that didn't stop Iowa from taking the seat there quickly. Some of the talk between specific agents worried him as such, making him feel like he was once again on the wrong side of the war. Violent talk, unforgiving language...It sent a shudder down his spine. He wasn't aware Sigma was taking notes of all of his responses. As such, he only gave a simple nod to respond to whoever was taking names of who arrived, not wanting to mess up and say something wrong. </s>"
338,"<s>[INST] Maine was the first one in the Pelican, and he sat in the very last seat deep into the Pelican. All his equipment was ready, his stealth parachute strapped on, and his camo more befitting the mission. Digitial camo, black and grey colors. His ghillie suit would do him no good. His guns were cleaned and fully loaded, his knife sharpened, and his HUD fully operational. Always ready for a mission.
He would be the first one to come out, taking a stealthier approach to get a good vantage point while the others caused a distraction down below so that he slipped in undetected. Once Maine was in position, he would move randomly around the tops of buildings, giving visual feedback as well as sniper fire whenever necessary. If need be, he was capable of locking in on targets through buildings and shooting them. Well, dependi [/INST] ng how many walls were in between. His sniper was powerful, but not go through three buildings powerful.
Maine didn't even look up when the others came in, his dark visor covering his face as light refused to reflect off his outfit. He wasn't used to team missions, especially ones this large. Solo missions were his forte, or at least small groups of people he trusted and he was in charge. But still, at least his job was a solo one. Protecting the lives of all the other members of the team. Even if he really didn't give a shit who died, he put the mission before anything else. Keeping the others from dying was his mission.
Granted, he only had to talk to them when he needed to.
""Ready?"" Delta chimed in, looking down at Maine from his shoulder.
""Of course. Let's see what you can do Delta.""
""You as well, Agent Maine."" </s>"
339,"<s>[INST] Washington
""Alright fellas lets get a move on!"" Washington signaled to the pilot to start the engines and leave. As they were moving in the pelican Washington went over the plan one more time. ""Here's the plan one more time. Myself, Agent California, Agent Montana and Agent Ohio will head to the reactor and ensure that it is stabilized returning power to the facility and to its defences. Once power is returned we will search for the Scientist.
The rest of you will work on distracting and drawing away the enemy from the reactor. That's you Agent Iowa and Agent Utah. Once the defences are back up the robots should help out making it easier to push back the Insurgents and force them off the planet or, wipe them out. Maine you're overwatch so keep an eye on all the soldiers but try not to expose yourself.""
Epsilon popped up on his shoulder as he was talking. ""Hey the Director has sent drones to survey the battlefield they just submitted a report of the current location of the enemy. Beth is there she is currently guarding the perimeter a long with a couple of dozen rebels.

Epsilon disappeared after they had reported. ""Well you heard the A.I. keep a look out, there's still two of the main members missing and another load of rebels that should be there.
A red light buzzed inside the pelican indicating they were approaching Maine's drop zone. After another minute the red light appeared again. Stepping into the pod he saw the door slide shut and his nerves began to play up.
""Great I love this par [/INST] t."" The pod slammed into the ground the door blowing off allowing Washington to exit. He, California, Montana and Agent Ohio had been dropped further away than the distraction squad, opening up the comms link he spoke to the teams. ""Alright, distraction Squad go make some noise you're free to open a can of hurt on them. Maine an eye on the enemy, looks from here like they may have some Rocket launchers. Okay Virginia we're moving in cautiously and quickly, no noise.""
As Washington's squad moved into the facility they met little resistance with only a few guards in there way. ""This is strange where the hell is everyone? You would think that this place would be guarded by the best of the best unless this is a trap. But why go to all that trouble?""
Beth
Beth was a rugged girl she had her two plasma rifles strapped to her hips as she surveyed the front of the research facility. Looking at the tracker on her wrist she saw an unidentified aircraft approaching. Signalling to one of the rebels they pointed their rocket launcher at. Locking on the missiles arced through the air. Beth watched the pelican trying to move away from them but was too late. Crashing to the ground she smiled inwardly.
""Alright guys and gals if our Intel is correct than we should have a bunch of agents approaching us soon. So prepare yourself."" The Rebels were heavily armed with forerunner tech they had stolen from the Directors shipments. More Rebels spilled out of the inside of the facility . They were armed with assault rifles and battle rifles. ""Get into position men don't give these guys an inch Simmons is working on hacking the facility and needs the time"". </s>"

""Ah so time for the drop,"" Montana stated entering his pod before the door shut and was then hurtling to the ground below. Once on the ground and given the orders to move out, he followed after Washington keeping his head on a swivel as they made their way into the facility. There was little resistance the further they made it in. Something wasn't right, for something the rebels were suppose to find important there seemed to be a lack of rebels keeping guard, even if the distraction team was doing their job to get their attention on them.
""So I'm not the only one getting a [/INST] bad feeling about this? Like Admiral Ackbar is going to jump out and state it's a trap,"" Montana spoke up looking around again at their current location with still little signs of resistance "",Shouldn't their be more guards, you know, guarding?"" It wasn't just the fact that he wasn't getting an opportunity to fight that was putting him on edge, there definitely was something off about the place that didn't sit well with him the further then made their way into the facility.
Keep your guard up, the disembodied voice of Omega stated in his head which Montana gave a slight head nod to. </s>"

Utah heard Zeta's voice as she rattled around her pod, the landing wasn't exactly as pleasant as getting into the pod but she digresses.

342,"<s>[INST] Everyone else had begun to step within the casings of their drop pods. It was strange, being sent out like this. When he was a child, before his careers started to engage in insurgency, Iowa had looked up towards the Orbital Drop Shock Troopers that bared the UNSC banner. They were extreme to any child's eyes. Anyone who fell from space and survived were considered heroes, pod or no pod. Fighting with intense skill to suppress insurgencies, invasions of other species and native lifeforms on new planets; they were living a dream only a kid could think up of. It was almost nostalgic for him to place his feet down into a pod of his own. Yet, at the same time, it was melancholic...
Iowa had killed humans alike, only for what he'd been brought up knowing. He had learnt to fear the pods, if he saw them falling down from the clouds above, it brought nightmarish visions of death and destruction; they were the very symbolic recreation of horror and brutality. Their tactics were unmatched at first, and it took years of practice and evasion to eventually be considered fit for counter-assaulting their strengths in small numbers. Seeing him step inside one made him hesitate, both filling him with a sense of pride and fear of what he'd become. But then again, those who surrounded him were Ex-ODSTs, at least a few of them were. Seeing their hardass presence was nerving, making him know that he had to love and hate them both at the same time.
""Please step into the drop-pod, Agent Iowa. You are delaying yourself and yourself only."" Iowa shook his head and hit the helmet he tightly wore. His armour wasn't considered bulky, and he had to make sure it wouldn't be. His AI was speaking the truth, he was only delaying himself. His team didn't care about him as a person, only as him as a soldier. And for his own personal sake, only he was affected by the outcomes of his hesitation. And so, he stepped inside.
Shortly after the door slid shut and he had taken his place, the pod shot out, and the view of pods being flung from the underside of the craft began to present itself in front of him. His head rattled gently from side to side as the ground began to hurtle closer and closer. He looked onto the screening, used for communicating to other pods.
""Agent Washington, I'm going to have to adjust course to ensure I land in the right zone...Just pray I don't whack into you by accident."" He smirked to himself, finally getting that sense of humour ba [/INST] ck into his system. The pod gently directed through the crowd of pods towards where he was supposed to be going, before finally slamming into the ground with a vast impact. ""Fuck...Don't see myself getting used to these anytime soon.""
His Heads-Up-Display began to flicker onwards as the sensor and armour ratings flashed on screen. A small box where Sigma's icon appeared in the top right, indicating that they had a connection. It was at least the up-most importance that the box remained there, as their neural connection would remain positive for as long as it did. Sigma was an important asset to his time as a Freelancer, so Iowa might as well have taken it for granted. His companion for this team, Utah, spoke to him.
""Ready as can be. Let's get this show on the road with a few little surprises."" The two moved onwards towards their objective, getting into position. Utah had taken point, looking at the seemingly worrying amount of guards that were stationed on this post. Iowa even peeped his head around the corner from behind Utah, just to be clear of how many there really were. It confused him, but he decided to live in the moment and meet the expectations of a loud show.
""Hey, Utah..."" From his hardened utility casing built into his armour's leg segments, he drew a small device clearly of an explosive material. ""Washing Machine did say we can make as much of a distraction as possible...How about we take it up a notch from expectation? Who knows, we might distract the entire planet-surface as well.""
When he had gotten her attention, he scanned the area with his eyes, looking for something that could provide an explosion big enough to grab the attention of some. A small, practically empty in the terms of guards, vehicle resting spot was almost adjacent to their position. Inside, from the looks of things, were a few small utility vehicles, one with a anti-personnel turret loosely locked onto the back of it. As Iowa ran for the side door, still concealed by whatever shadows that were available, he quickly opened the door and tossed it inside like a Frisbee. Wherever it slid in that vehicle shelter, it would definitely catch most of what was inside the small shed-like structure. He ran back, and held out a small handheld device...A trigger detonator.
""If you'd like to do the honour, Agent Utah."" If his helmet were off, a thick grin would be present, as he waited. It was her time to trigger it once the others were in position. </s>"

45th Empire Day
Today is the 45th anniversary of the formation of the Empire. Parades and military marches are taking place across many planets. Fleets have canceled today’s exercises to celebrate. On the capital planet of Mars, truly impressive fireworks displays are being viewed. Most workers have gotten the day off to view their local planetary parade and subsequent defense fleet demonstration. There have been rumors of a new armor platform being introduced for security efforts during the parades.
Genocide of Halion II
Reports are coming in from independent freighters and cargo haulers that the planet of Halion II seems to be completely lifeless. Corpses litter the ground, and it’s unsure of what happened. There is [/INST] a heavy Imperial presence in the system. One thing is for sure: this was the doing of the Empire. How exactly they managed it is unknown, however.
Rebel Cell on Geon Crushed
Recently, contact was lost with Gem Squadron on Geon, and the worst was feared. This has been confirmed with the public execution of a number of people within the cell and many of their sympathizers. Other cells remain active on the planet, but Gem Squadron was by far the largest and most important on the planet.
Senate Overruled by Emperor
A Senate vote introduced to the floor that would lower the military funding was recently hit by a unilateral veto by Emperor Zelv. It otherwise would have been nearly passed with the rogue senator group the Delegation voting unanimously in approval. The Delegation has had its power hit with its senators showing up dead, or worse, but it remains a force to reckon with in the Senate. </s>"

Carter wandered into the office as he held a cream coloured file with four distinct news details in its walls. He seemed focused on what he was really. Being the control panel or the speaker for the Resistance Radio wasn't always jump through a hoop then get thrown a biscuit or a bone. As Carter looked at the pages of the reports. He then placed himself in a chair as he leaned in it propping his feet on the table. At the moment he didn't know where anybody else was and as he scanned round the room he seemed a bit hopeless. The team of the Resistance Radio was usually always here and for some reason out of the blue they all scattered it seemed like. Having a pipe placed in between his lips. His left hand came up and held onto the wood. ""Mhm..."" He mumbled as he kept reading. Carter then removed the pipe from his lips. ""Interesting...interesting."" He repeated as he scanned his eyes up an [/INST] d down the papers. Four reports all interesting and they had to at least pick one to broadcast. Carter then set the papers down onto the desk where he found them in the first place he was returning them now. He then pulled his feet off from the desk then stood up. Placing the pipe back into his mouth he puffed it a few more times as he started walking out of the room.
Carter usually has a thick British accent when he talked looked around. Speaking as what was on his mind. ""Where the bloody hell is the Scotland yard?"" He questioned as he peaked his head out of the office puffing on his pipe a few more times. Just like an old animated cartoon character that is based off from Sherlock Holmes or something. He always called the Resistance Radio Team the Scotland yard for an odd reason. Though it was more of an inside joke he made at dinner one night with everybody. From that day on he preferred to them as the 'Scotland Yard' or 'Little Army guys'. He enjoyed making a joke once in awhile even if it was one of the stupidest jokes you would ever hear. Carter tried his best to cheer up everyone when he could. </s>"

All lit up and it started speaking again ""Everybody else is probably getting wasted with the gang that brought me here."" it states as he just blinks and grabs the pipe out of his mouth. ""Oh, your the robot they were talking about."" Carter mentions he's heard a little about him.
Nodding his head he smiled slightly. ""I'm Carter Patriot. You can just call me Carter or General."" He says while his voice mumbles a bit from the pipe being stuck back into his mouth. Listening to the robotic sofware talk he nodded his head to its words. Walking over to where the toaster was placed. ""And may I know your name?"" Carter questioned the intriguing little contraption.
Looking over to the reports as the AI unit started rambling on about them. Taking his pipe out of his mouth again he coughed a bit covering his mouth with the back [/INST] of his right wrist. ""Mhm. Yes, their all pretty detailed reports to be so small...though we have to pick one of them to be broadcast on the radio this evening."" Carter says as his eyes lift off the reports then go over to the AI unit. ""Now could you be a sport and maybe tell me where the others are with your crew?"" Carter asked as he got more to his knees to be face to camera with the robot. ""It would make my life a whole lot easier."" He mentions as he looks into the camera.
""Ah, blast them!"" He raised his voice and shot up. Throwing his hand up in the air. ""If they want to send a force of a billion supernovas.

Waving his pipe back and forth as he looked at Lil'Mac. ""I'll just have to do it without them then."" He said with sarcasm. Carter wasn't serious at all.

Jackson stood at the edge of the forest treeline as he watched a caravan of Regime trucks driving towards the city. A few months ago, he'd have been one of the soldiers riding along in one of those transport trucks, but here he was. A disgrace to his family name. A rebel. Fighting the fight from the other side of the war he'd been a part of for so long. Sure, the war had been over for a couple decades, but it never stopped in the streets. Pokemon were still being captured, people were still being taken in for 'questioning', and most were put to work like slaves by the Regime. The lower-class was forced to submit to that fate, the upper-class having the advantage of being first pick for Regime infantry and officer ranks.
For Jackson, his way in had been through the family name. His uncle was a Regime officer, a high ranking one at that. It was an opportunity of a lifetime, and Jackson's parents wouldn't let him pass it up. Thrust into a life he never wanted, the Regim [/INST] e did what they could to make him an impressionable soldier. Having spent his first four years in Infantry ranks till they promoted him to an officer. The last two years had been horrible for him. Whatever 'training' he'd been put through was starting to slowly wear off. Jackson began reverting back to his old ways, his old thought process. His own way of thinking. None of what he was made to do was right, by any means.
As he stood there watching the last truck pass, Jackson thought a lot about the early days of his enlistment. How could his parents have agreed to putting him into this? Making him do these things to people, and pokemon alike. He never got to ask them if it was their true belief, or if they were just scared of Big Man in the sky who was constantly watching 'his people'. His parents had both died in the winter before last, one passing a few weeks after the other. Jackson shook his head of the saddening thoughts and turned to press on through the forests, his Houndour padding along at his side quietly, always vigilant. </s>"
352,"<s>[INST] Things had been.... different lately. A sense of growing unease among all parties, in Isaiah's eyes. It seemed like civilians were edgier, and for good reason. As the resistance grew bolder and bolder, the Regime would logically start to crack down on freedoms, as any fascist system tended to do. Isaiah had started to become more reliant on scouting ahead of time, and his supply runs had grown increasingly dangerous as well. ""I need a partner..."" He grumbled to himself, knowing that a second pair of eyes would make things so much easier.
Life for Isaiah had not been easy. Born to a poor family, he was pushed into a near slavery, working long hours as early as he was able, until he was exhausted. But Isaiah had always been good at escaping and hiding, and that was just as true when he was a child. He avoided work whenever possible, and poor record keeping meant [/INST] he wasn't always missed. This was how he developed his skill for avoiding eyes, something he practices almost every day, and has for as long as he can remember. It was too bad that his home had been wiped out, but now... nothing would prevent him for doing anything he could to sabotage Regime efforts to crush the resistance.
Isaiah was in the forests, somewhere not too far from Jackson. A vigilant eye out, the young man had been tracking a hunter, one of the Regime who searched out wild pokemon and captured them for use later. But some hours earlier, Isaiah had lost the trail, and without a pokemon to help him track the man, Isaiah was lost. He hadn't been trained to follow the signs, and while logic had gotten him far, he was unable to find any more hints. Not one to give up, Isaiah had continued to push towards Jackson, not knowing the man was ahead of him. </s>"

Raven's arms were tied up to the trunk of a tree above her head, blood starting to drip down into her eyes as she noticed the Regime officer turn back towards her, electric baton crackling loudly. She wouldn't allow them to see that she, to her unfortunate discomfort, was in quite a bit of pain. Raven scowled at the man closing the distance between them, shifting uncomfortably as the ropes around her wrists tightened, starting to give quite a nasty burn. The man simply laughed and leaned in close, inhaling deeply. Was he... smelling her?! He raised a hand and attempted to tuck a stray hair behind her ear before Raven pulled away.
""They're always sexier when they've got a fight in 'em. Ain't that right, boys?"" A gang of laughter and consensus followed before he continued, ""Awe, what's the matter sweetheart? Ain't a lovin' type of gal?"" With no hesitation, not so much as skipping a beat, Raven spit at the officer directly in the face. Blood spatter covered his ugly mug, he angrily wiped it away and slapped Raven directly across her own face. Raven coughed up some more blood, spilling from her mouth like a small river flowing over her lips. 'Where's El?' she thought to herself, glancing around but it was hard to see with 3 sets of truck headlights blinding her vision passed a few yards out. Almost as soon the thought left her mind, the truck lights began to flicker before all 3 went out.
The men turned every which way to try figuring out what had happened, their pokemon standing at attention beside them growling, each growing as uneasy as their masters. Raven's blood-stained lips curved up into a smile as she whispered just loud enough for the captain who'd been assaulting her previously could hear, ""Marco."" With that, a loud explosion from behind the car to her right sounded off, the men screaming at their pokemon to chase after the thing that caused it. A fairly large yellow blur came charging from behind, bulldozing the growlithe and houndour in it's path, flailing it's arms at the soldiers attempting to shoot their net blasters at it.
Screaming incoherently, the Electabuzz charged straight at the captain and with both hands, slammed the poor m [/INST] an off to the side. Raven smiled as Electabuzz yanked the ropes free from the trunk of the tree. ""Sadistic game of Marco-Pollo, eh?"" His baring of his fangs was enough for Raven to know he agreed, his eyes were still had a slight red glow to them from his fit of rage. It wasn't time for looking him over, or dwelling on the pains she was feeling all over her body, it was time to run. And run, they did.


Near Interaction With: Isaiah 

Jackson walked with his hands wrapped tightly around his assault rifle, looking around the never-ending sea of trees surrounding him as he kept moving forward. Houndour stopped in his tracks and turned his head to look behind him, his body following slowly. He began to growl, teeth bared as he stared off into the trees where they'd come from just before. Jack hadn't noticed Houndour fall behind but definitely heard him growl, turning to confront whatever it was Houndour was at an unease about, holding up his rifle aiming at whatever may be coming. A blast off in the distance to the right caused him to stop, turning his attention to said noise. Both him and Houndoor began to run towards it, Jackson carrying his rifle close to his chest and at the ready in case he needed it.
What Jack saw was something he hadn't seen in a long time. An Electabuzz. Wild, maybe. Definitely wasn't Regime. Only reason he knew that was, the damned thing attacking a group of soldiers who looked to be previously interrogating some young woman. From behind a tree, Jackson stayed out of sight and watched the scene unfold. The pokemon causing the chaos was the largest one he'd ever seen, looked to be a whopping four foot tall, compared to most of the type who barely made three and a half feet at most. Once the excitement had calmed a tad and the pokemon rescued the woman who was clearly it's master fled, Jack too, turned away from the scene and started off towards the way he'd been going before. He would have walked into the disaster to see if his ex-fellow soldiers were alright, since he could pull it off, still being in his uniform and all. But in case they were part of the ranks that knew of his dishonorable discharge, he would rather not risk the trouble. </s>"

""The hell was that?"" Isaiah grumbled, hearing the electabuzz scream out. He had never seen the electric type before, and had no idea what to make of the sound, other than it seemed like a war cry. So Isaiah did what any naturally curious person would. He ran at near breakneck speed towards the sound, only stopping when he ended up 20 feet behind a houndour and a man in Regime uniform (). He had been a bit too loud, a bit too careless, and the man was sure to look.
So this was it.... Running face first into a Regim [/INST] e soldier. You know, it was kinda surprising this hadn't happened earlier. With a silent grunt, Isaiah jumped straight up, catching a branch and hauling his slender frame up into the tree. If he was luckier than a leprechaun sporting a jacket made of four leaf clovers and shoes made OF horse shoes then MAYBE Jackson and his houndour wouldn't look directly at Isaiah and notice him 10 feet above them. Then again, Isaiah was still within a normal cone of sight for the two.  Well ain't this about as fun as dancing on broken glass barefoot.... Why don't I carry a gun anymore? </s>"

The sound of an explosion in the distance alerted Niamh first, and the sudden tense in her muscles caused the Metang to stop instinctively, awaiting orders. ”Head towards the explosion,” Niamh ordered, slipping her clipboard and pen into her backpack before standing again. As soon as she cleared the trees, the source of the explosion was clear: an Electabuzz, bright yellow-and-black, zigzagging through the forest with its rebel owner.
Here Niamh’s choices opened up—she could either fly over and try to capture the rebel, or she could act the fool and simply fly over to the wreck. However, should anyone see her in the air right [/INST] now, they guess that she had no intention of capturing the trainer and therefore no loyalty to the Regime. I suppose a bruise or two would convince the cocky airheads in the Interrogation Department that pretty face can’t do much outside of the lab?

Metang obeyed, gliding over silently but quickly. Niamh knelt down, gripping the installed metal handles for that very purpose as the pair came to a drifting hover over the Electabuzz and its trainer—a black-haired girl, by the looks of it. Niamh sighed. Well, here goes nothing.
”Hey!” Niamh shouted down at the girl. ”Stop right there!” </s>"
356,"<s>[INST] Shade
A few hundred yards away, a girl watched the action through the scope of her rifle. She’d been tracking the brunette with the clipboard, most likely one of the so-called “scientists”, for a while, looking for an opportunity. Silent kills were the best when it came to dealing with the Regime; Shade would keep watch while Razor went for the kill. By the time anybody realized what had happened, it would be too late; they'd have the safety of distance and their prey would be thoroughly on edge. Sniping was loud and drew attention, plus the hunting Pokemon were annoyingly good at tracking her down once they were let loose, but she could usually get two or three before having to move. Unfortunately, the presence of the Metang and the general lack of cover made it more difficult. Steel Pokemon always were difficult kills.
The prisoner made things more complicated. Shade knew better than most that it tended to be a very short-term state, and it was seldom a pleasant one. She'd seen it before: in all likelihood, the girl would have a temporary stay in a tiny cell, followed by an interrogation in which anything was allowed, then a mockery of a trial before her summary, and possibly publicly televised execution. If she was lucky. The unlucky ones were an exercise in imagination that Shade preferred not to do.
Unfortunately, there hadn't been a great deal she could do. As much as Shade might have wanted to help, the girl was surrounded by soldiers. Shade and Razor were good, but not THAT good. One would have to be suicidal to just charge in.
Apparently somebody was. An being rather successful at it, if the exploding trucks were any indication. An Electabuzz? Didn't know they lived out here. Things began moving very fast, and very surprising. The Electabuzz fr [/INST] eed the girl, and after a brief moment the pair took off, straight in Shade’s direction. It would take only seconds for the disoriented guards to give pursuit. Her previous target was now moving to intercept. She'd seen Metang move quickly across open terrain, but the trees would force it to slow down or risk clotheslining its master on a branch. As amazing as that would be to see, the Regime made sure their Pokemon were too well “trained” to let that happen. Shade made her decision.
The sharp crack of the rifle echoed through the trees, and one of the guards chasing the fleeing escapee slumped to the ground. She knew Razor was watching everything, and the Sneasel was smart enough to realize what she wanted. He wouldn't be happy about it, but he would understand. Loading in another round, she aimed a snarling Growlithe that was closing on the girl's heels. Another pull of the trigger, and the Puppy Pokemon went tumbling nose over tail. A black blur leaped from amid the forest undergrowth, and blood spurted from the neck of another guard as the Sneasel disappeared as quickly as it had arrived. He'd be heading up into the trees now, attack from another vantage point.
Shade turned her aim back to the scientist girl. She was getting close now, and if she ordered Metang to use its psychic abilities, it would be all over for the escapee. Shade took aim, leading the shot, but a moving target heading in a perpendicular direction was not an easy shot to make, as the bullet caught the scientist in the shoulder and knocked her off her seat. Dammit! The lack of a clean kill made Shade grit her teeth. She only had a handful of bullets left on her, and she doubted that she would get the opportunity to loot the bodies. This girl she was helping had better be worth it. </s>"

The shooting pain in Niamh's shoulder surprised her, to say the least. Her brain told her it was a bullet wound and that the bullet had missed bone, but her nerves told a different story of raw, searing agony. The impact of the bullet shocked her so much the Niamh’s grip on the Metang’s bars loosened, causing her to fall from the Pokemon. As all Metang are trained for such situations, the Pokemon quickly swerved and caught its assignment in a gray-blue blur. Agility, Niamh recognized dimly, a faint smirk on her face. Glad to see I got one of the few slabs of floating metal with brains.
Niamh picked herself up off her side to stand on the Metang. The escapee with the Electabuzz was nowhere to be seen, but now Niamh had a new target—the girl who had shot her. Niamh could see her clearly now through the trees, crouching with [/INST] a rifle. Their eyes met. Niamh’s brain whirled.
Options: fight or flight. Question: was the non-lethal shot intentional? Yes: shot missed bone, traveling between clavicle and scapula; has not made a second shot. No: Shot would have hit superior vena cava or even aorta if hadn’t moved; girl’s stance is tense—sees me as danger.
One hand gripping her shoulder tightly to stem the blood flow, Niamh’s eyes scanned the shadowy forest for further life. A flash of black and red indicated that there was—presumably a Pokemon, judging by the speed. By color, it was probably a dark Pokemon.
”Metang. Agility and magnet rise,” Niamh said, crouching down and clamping a hand on a bar. The Metang complied, heightening its speed to a blur before rising further off the ground. ”Head back to base.”
The pair disappeared in a gray-blue flash towards the Regime base. </s>"

Raven was running as fast as she could but of course no one was fast enough to outrun the Regime's trained hounds. She could hear them coming from behind her, tailing her every dip and dodge when suddenly a shot range out through the valley. Then another, and suddenly there were no pursuing footsteps directly behind h- and another shot. Now there were none that she could hear. Raven slowed down to a stop to catch her breath, standing bent over with her hands on her knees, taking long, deep breathes. From behind, a voice called out. ""Hey!"" Raven looked over her shoulder, assuming she'd see her rescuer. She was wrong. ""Stop right there!"" A Regime Scientist.
Raven's heart dropped and she immediately shoved Electabuzz into a separate direction to run and began running another route. She wouldn't be caught, not again. Not twice in one friggin' day! The large metal pokemon was gaining on her as well, now, and Raven only feared the worst. Another sharp crack of a shot rang out, followed by a hard thud behind her. Against her better judgement, Raven turned to see what had happened to the Scientist that'd been in her pursuit, finding her on the ground but still very much alive. Quickly scanning the surrounding area, she realized the Scientist was the only one following her. Raven smirked and began to make yet another run for it, thanking her guardian angel, whoever that may be, and hoped maybe one day they'd cross paths so she could give a proper thanks. She'd been too busy staring behind her to realize where exactly she was running, and ran directly into a young man () who, unto her knowledge had been climbing the tree, both collapsing onto the floor. Raven shoved the guy off of her, scrambling away from him as she looked him over quickly, realizing he wasn't Regime. She let out a mental sigh of relief. Not much to her surprise though, as she looked over, there stood a Regime officer (Jackson) with his houndour, both looking down at them with flat-faced expressions. ""Shit.""


Interactions: Isaiah () || Raven (Self)

Jackson's Houndour beside him began to growl softly, it's back arched slightly, the fur raised up alon [/INST] g its spine. Holding up his rifle, Jackson took aim and scanned the forest, spinning around when he heard what sounded like a tree branch snap, a feminine grunt and a loud collapse of weight. Just 20ft from Jackson and Houndour lay two civilians, one being the girl he'd watched escape from the other soldiers. Obviously they weren't together by the way they looked at each other, but then the girl looked at him. Her eyes widened just slightly as she cursed to herself. The girl looked beaten up pretty bad, and although it wasn't his fault, Jackson felt bad, himself. That was the kind of thing he'd been forced to do over the years being one of them.
There was a silent stand-off for a minute before Jackson slowly lowered his gun, seeing the boy had neither weapon nor pokemon at his side. At least that he knew of. The young man, looking to be not much younger than himself, wouldn't be much harm to him. Jackson was a respectful young man in himself. If an enemy didn't have a weapon, neither would he. It was that simple. An old view that the Regime laughed off. Kill or be killed. Regime never let themselves be the latter, if they could help it. Jackson realized the girl's Electabuzz was nowhere to be seen, but with the kind of destruction it had caused with a decent squad of soldiers and their own pokemon, it was clear this was a fight he didn't want to pick. He quickly slid his rifle over his shoulder, holding up his hands to show he meant no harm. Raising a hand to his partner, Houndour saw the silent command and immediately calmed down, sitting on it's haunches at Jackson's side just staring at the strangers before them.
""My name is Jackson Kincaid."" Looking around to be sure there were no lurking Regime soldiers around, he met their eyes again and continued, ""I mean you no harm."" Jackson swallowed hard, only slightly nervous, that missing Electabuzz was a real reason to be. Though his instinct was to try locating the dangerous beast, Jackson stood his ground and stared back at the two people before him. He hoped they'd not give him too much grief if they decided to ban together and try overtaking him and Houndour. One could only hope they'd be as civil as he was trying to be, right now. </s>"

He groaned, looking up into the eyes of the woman as she backed off. ""Well. This is unexpected...."" He glanced over to the supposed regime officer, rolling up and back onto his feet in one fluid move that kept his eyes on Jackson at all times. His hand reached back to his hip, where the gun he once carried openly no longer rested. ""Great....""
Then Jackson introduced himself and Isaiah's eyebrows rose. He considered the possibilities. H [/INST] e didn't have a pokemon, and wasn't armed. The man obviously had both. The woman... Well, Isaiah wasn't sure what she had. But he had a feeling she wasn't holding a gun. Non-regime members tended to shoot first, ask questions later when their lives were in danger. And for good reason. So... There was no good reason for Jackson to keep them alive if he was a regime member. At least, not without using his gun to do it. ""Just... call me vantage...."" He said, glancing to both of them and waiting, knees bent some and an obviously cautious nature to his body language. </s>"

A faint rustling sound came from the tree behind Jackson, and a dark shape dropped down onto his back. Before anyone could breath, the Sneasel unsheathed one of its claws and pressed it up against the former Regime soldier’s throat, perfectly placed to slice a line straight across. It would take much less than a minute for him to bleed out, though he would be dead well before then from his lungs filling with his own blood.
For several heartbeats, silence fell over the group, then a feminine voice called out from the trees. ”What are you waiting for, Razor? Kill him [/INST] .”
The Sneasel’s eyes flicked between its captive and the group standing before them several times, and it made a sound that was somewhere between a hiss and squeak.
”What do you mean, “no”?” Shade stepped out of the trees, scowling harshly. She was pissed that the scientist girl had survived, and not in any mood to be merciful. ”He’s Regime, we kill bastards like him.” Razor answered with a chittering noise, though he didn’t remove his claw from Jackson’s throat, and Shade’s scowl became even darker. ”I don’t care what he said! He’s with the Regime, he deserves to die.” </s>"
361,"<s>[INST] Lilith

Lilith was alone on a hilltop overlooking the valley below her. Why, however, she was unsure. Watching -doing nothing- was a boring job, one for petty soldiers, not spec ops. Still, her CO had commanded her to watch over the kill, make sure nothing went wrong. ""She's a high priority target, very dangerous"", he had said. Bullshit. Lilith thought. She was fairly certain he was just punishing her for her last assignment -which had ended in failure. If someone would've listened to me rather than run off to play -- the thought was cut short by some commotion on scene. Her eyes focused in on the Electabuzz that had just made its explosive entrance. ""Wow. Why can't you be that useful?"" she seemed to say to the wind. In response, a stray tongue materialized out of thin air, followed by the sound of someone blowing a raspberry. Lilith figured she was now covered by some sort of formless ectoplasmic spit. ""You're such a child,"" she said disdainfully, ""You know what to do. Gengar, kill."" With that the apparition left her, off to -hopefully- perform its duties.
Though typically sparsely populated, this forest was quite lively at the present. From her position high above the action, Lilith watched as everything unfolded. The rebel below seemed to be getting away. In chase, the scientist, floated on her standard-issue Metang. The sniper -which Lilith would've missed had she not been trained to look for the glare of an enemy scope- was stationed at a position on the adjacent hill. After watching the sniper down two of her regime compadres, Lilith determined it to be the most vital target; the thrill of the chase would soon begin. Hopefully Gengar would be there by now, in position for when he was needed. With that, Lilith silently began moving towards the target. She hoped, a [/INST] t the very least, that this one would be more challenging than those prior.
Thankfully for Lilith, she was downwind from the target, which had now become a group of targets. Lucky me! she thought, pleased to find such a large helping of... playthings. From a vantage point above the clearing in which the four rebels had now gathered, Lilith waited. Finally, she saw a rippling of light in front of the sniper. Simultaneously, all the light in the clearing seemed to dim, the air growing suddenly colder. Out of the ground rose an ominous darkness. With her pokemon preoccupied, she's as good as dead. Lilith thought as a Gengar formed out of the strange blackness. The performance was going so well, Lilith had to fight down shivers. She suspected by this time the rebels might also be shivering, though for an entirely different reason. Blood-red eyes leveled with those of the sniper, quickly enough to prevent a response, but not enough so that no fear could be felt by the victim. Lilith let out a shrill laugh at the sight of her success.
...Wait a minute. The sniper had yet to fall down dead. Lilith's head turned questioningly. What the... Lilith realized with dread that Gengar had in fact not killed the target, but had instead passed a wet, slimy tongue over her face. Just as fast as it had appeared, Gengar vanished into the wind. ""AHHHHH! You idiot!"" Lilith screamed. ""Until next time! I'm not finished with you yet!"" she yelled to the group below her while retreating back into the depths of the forest.
Lilith, once she had distanced herself enough to be sure she wouldn't be detected, called the failure into her CO. Though she expected punishment, she instead received more orders. Follow them. Figure out what they are up to. We need to know if the rebellion is organizing again. </s>"

""My name is Jackson Kincaid. I mean you no harm."" Raven glared up at the man, not believing his words for a second. Regime weren't trustworthy. Once she caught her breath some from colliding into the guy beside her, having had the wind practically knocked right out of her, she put her index and thumb to her mouth and whistled softly. Soft enough for surrounding Regime officers still in the area not to hear but Electabuzz would hear it. She knew he'd come find her once he heard the whistle. He was a great tracker, even for his breed which didn't typically care to do such things.
""Just,"" the guy seemed to eyeball the soldier, with good reason, too. Who were they to believe his lies? Definitely not stupid, that's for sure. ""-call me 'Vantage'."" Raven looked up at Vantage and scoffed, shaking her head as she got up and dusted herself off, all the while keeping an eye on Kincaid. ""Yeah, I don't think so, Cowboy. Ain't telling you shit. You can take me back to base and try getting it out of me there, but here, I won't give up a thing."" Glancing at Vantage, she looked at him like 'What the hell is wrong with you?!' before smiling as Electabuzz broke through the trees and came to stand behind her. The Electabuzz, at average height would stand roughly at 3ft tall, however hers was about a foot and a half shorter than herself and a foot taller than most in it's breed.
""Why should we believe you? I get it, you put your gun down and told your little power pup over there to heel,"" Raven smiled when the Houndour beside Kincaid bared it's teeth at her, ""-but seriously, you're Regime. You assholes always have another motive up your sleeves."" Before Raven could completely finish, a flash of black and red fell from the trees above Kincaid and landed on is back. A Sneasel was now mounted on his shoulders, it's sharp claws at his neck ready to slice him wide open. ""What are you waiting for, Razor? Kill him."" Raven looked around for the voice that sprang from nearby, a questionable expression on her face. Electabuzz was growing uneasy beside her, baring his teeth and breathing a bit harder than usual. A soft buzzing from his own electricity building within him as he stared, unmoving at the Sneasel. The Sneasel looked between Kincaid, Vantage and Raven as if wondering whether or not it should kill the man in it's grasp. I mean, not in front of all these nice people, right?
The Sneasel made a sound, and that's when not only the voice came again, the person it belonged to emerged from the trees. Both with an angry expression and tone about them. ""What do you mean, 'no'? He’s Regime, we kill bastards like him."" The pokemon seemed to return fire with it's own sorts of chattering, the trainer becoming even more fiercely upset with the creature. ""I don’t care what he said! He’s with the Regime, he deserves to die."" The pokemon stayed in position, and Raven reached back to gently nudge Electabuzz back. Not in an attempt to make another run, but holding him back from joining in. She knew he would if Raven let him, but this wasn't their fight. The girl and the Sneasel seemed to have it handled.
Just then, out of thin air, appeared a bright purple ghost-type pokemon. 'Gengar! Shit, if only I hadn't used Electabuzz's ball on him, I would possibly have a go at catching it.' Raven thought to herself. What she wouldn't give for a Haunter, but a Gengar would do, too. The [/INST] great big ghost then spat out it's large tongue and drug it across the huntress's face before disappearing into the wind, again. Raven couldn't help but let out a slight giggle which she quickly choked down, she didn't want to piss the huntress off and be her next target. And yet, another voice came from above, causing Raven to look up for the one it belonged to. ""AHHHHH! You idiot! Until next time! I'm not finished with you yet!""

Jackson looked between both of them, ready to reply to the girl's response but was cut off by a sudden weight on his back, a couple of sharp blades pressed to his neck. Immediately, Jackson placed a hand at his side to calm his now, full-attack-mode Houndour, forcing his pal to sit impatiently. Houndour sat there eyeing the Sneasel all the while, a slight red glisten in his eyes. He wanted to wrap his mouth around the thing's neck and do unto it what it seemed to be wanting to do to his master. Jackson kept Houndour at bay with a simple hand held out in a fist, meaning simply, 'hold' or 'stay'.
The chattering and voices around Jackson peaked his interest, and he wanted to turn to see who the pokemon on his back belonged to. Wanted desperately to face his attacker, but found himself staring between Vantage and the girl. Was this.. mercenary with either of them? Jackson swallowed hard, feeling the pokemon's claws digging deeper into his throat. A small, thin line of scarlet running down his neck. He dared not move, nor did he dare try to speak. In a situation like this, all Jackson felt he should do was comply. He didn't have the upper hand, and he didn't want to seem like he'd do something. His rifle was safely tucked against his back between himself and the Sneasel. His knife was strapped to his belt, but what good would it do him to try wrestling for it before the damned beast on his back just slit his throat and be done with it. None.
Jackson grit his teeth together tightly, hearing a lick! and the girl in front of him try not to laugh, raising his eyebrow in confusion. 'The fuck just happened?' he thought to himself. From the trees then came a voice, not from the huntress that stood not too far from him, but a new one. The sound of retreat was a bit of relief, but it also sounded as though they had quite a military tone to their voice. 'Regime?' Jackson was almost desperate enough for them to come to his rescue, even if the woman had known he was a dishonorable discharge on the run from said Regime. He didn't wanna die. Not here, and definitely not like this. The girl had been right about one thing, before, in her name-calling. He was a true 'cowboy'. Jackson wished to go out ""guns blazin'.""
Taking a deep breath, Jackson peeked out of the corner of his eye towards the huntress behind him and spoke in a calm tone. ""I'm not a soldier. I simply stole this garb off of a dead one in hopes to get through some of the camps I had to travel through a few miles back. If you don't believe me, travel back south-east about 4 miles and you'll find the massive campsite full of the lot. I got no quarrel with ya'! So if you wouldn't mind, let me go and we can speak in a more formal manner."" Jackson's hand was still held out in a fist towards his pokemon, holding houndour in his place. The dark pokemon looked back and forth between his trainer and the two threatening his life, waiting for his next order - whatever it may be. </s>"

Interactions: Kinda everyone really....
Thoughts raced through Isaiah's mind. What to do, what to do. Back on his feet, no gun. No weapon at all actually. Why had he stopped carrying it... that's right. He would have shot Jackson by now if he hadn't. Not a good idea.... Sniper in the woods. Ghost pokemon around... Sneasal and Houndour.... Isaiah ran fingers through his hair and glanced about, wanting to just yell at everyone to shut the hell up for half a second. But no... They wouldn't listen. He was just a kid in the woods.
That gave him an idea. There was a gun in his backpack, if he could assemble the damn thing. But... No ammo. Shit. But then, another thought came to him. Something one of them said. ""He is Regime, he deserves to die?"" Isaiah quoted, staring at Jackson for emphasis. ""Is that what you think? Because if so, you should go jump off a cliff. Seriously, how close minded and hateful can you actually get without becoming Regime? Because I think you are there. If all you do is go around murdering people because of the organization they are with.""
Isaiah was pissed off. That mentality was what HE wa [/INST] s fighting against. That was the thinking HE wanted to stop. The mentality of 'The ends justify the means' was exactly what the Regime was likely to say, how they acted. Shoot first, ask questions later. It was a part of the reason they were feared and hated. Have an unliscened pokemon with you? It was taken, and you were probably dead. Get called a rebel? You died. No trail, no fairness. It sickened him that some people out there wanted to fight that sort of hatred and fascism, with the exact same thing and call themselves rebels or freedom fighters. ""Freaking ridiculous.""
Isaiah turned. ""Oh yeah. Those of us who don't want to be caught by the regime? I suggest we move. You know. Since several of them are dead and haven't checked in via radio. there are bound to be more coming. Especially with the metang riding scientist running back to a base and nobody chasing her down? I'm going to scavenge the bodies, then I'm out."" And like that, Isaiah slipped into the trees and down towards the bodies, his hood up and black clothes blending quite well into the scenery as he began to dig through the remains of the squad for supplies. </s>"
364,"<s>[INST] Shade
When the air became dimmer and colder, Shade became even more guarded than she already was. There were only a few Pokemon that she knew of who could have such an effect, and with most of those acting hastily was a good way to end up dead. The fact that most Pokemon had little to no conception of good or bad had little bearing on how dangerous they could be.
She looked around warily, trying to locate the source of the change and hoping that the others would take the hint and not do anything stupid that might provoke the new arrival. When a patch of ground darkened and smiled at her with crimson eyes, she froze. Gengar. Of all the Spectral Ones that she could have encountered, this one was the least desirable on account of their capricious temperaments. Gengar were notoriously difficult to predict, especially wild ones, and their moods could change by the second; one moment harmless and playful pranksters, the next persistent and cruel tormentors.
Still, this was not the first time that Shade had dealt with Ghosts, and she made no effort to conceal her consternation. Much like many Psychic types, with whom they shared a number of similarities, Ghosts were very sensitive to emotions, and if Gengar's had any consistency it was that their actions often were to provoke responses. It was a delicate line to walk. Maintain a stoic face, and the Gengar might be impressed at the display of self-control, or insulted at how little its efforts were thought of. Show fear, and it might leave having gotten what it desired, or it might persist in its games.
For her part, Shade chose a middle ground; as the Shadow Pokemon rose up out of the ground to float in front of her, she allowed it to see that it had indeed succeeded in frightening her, but now that she was aware of its presence, that fear would not control her. She also lowered her rifle a little and bent her head, murmuring, ”Welcome, honoured Spectre. May the night’s embrace aid you in your wanderings.”
The Gengar's smile faltered, apparently surprised at her words. Its leering eyes narrowed, as though it suspected a trick of some sort. When none was forthcoming, it abruptly sniggered and lunged forward, swiping its broad tongue up her face, knocking her hood back and leaving her a sticky mess. Slightly stunned by the wholly unexpected tongue-bath, Shade could only watch as the Gengar dissolved into air, still sniggering at her, its crimson eyes the last to vanish.
... Thanks?
A shrill shout startled her back to reality. Clearly feminine, but far enough away that the words were indistinct, the voice’s owner had already vanished as Shade looked about for it. Sti [/INST] ll, it did serve as a good reminder that they were all still very near to enemy territory. Best to deal with things here quickly and move on, it was doubtful that the exploding trucks had gone unnoticed. Even if they had, once the trucks failed to report in, and the plumes of smoke were seen, somebody would put two and two together and come investigating. Shade wanted to be long gone by that time.
""I'm not a soldier. I simply stole this garb off of a dead one in hopes to get through some of the camps I had to travel through a few miles back. If you don't believe me, travel back south-east about 4 miles and you'll find the massive campsite full of the lot. I got no quarrel with ya'! So if you wouldn't mind, let me go and we can speak in a more formal manner.""
The uniformed man’s words did make her pause though. Over the past few years, Shade had been no stranger to looting Regime corpses. Things like ammunition were difficult to come by in the wild, even when limiting her bullets to soldiers. His reasoning was somewhat sound as well, back north you dressed for the weather, or the weather would kill you as quickly as any gun. If he was telling the truth about the camp though (she'd come out of the northeast), why was he still wearing the uniform? Only Regime soldiers wore them, and impersonating one was almost as bad as having an unlicensed Pokemon. Plus, he was lucky that she hadn't already shot him.
As she thought about it, she ignored the other boy entirely. Shade had no interest in dealing with naive morons who still deluded themselves into thinking that the Regime could be reasoned with. It didn't want to be reasoned with; the only thing the Regime cared to understand was exploiting Pokemon and murdering anyone who disagreed with them. You were either with the Regime, or you were against them, there was no middle ground. She make those rules, the Regime did, and anyone who made the choice to side with the Regime (and they always had a choice) would get no mercy from her. That was the reality of war, he'd see that soon enough.
”... Come’re Razor.” The Sneasel’s little ears twitched at her words, and he leaped back up into the trees, easily making his way back to her. Her gun, however, remained firmly trained on the uniformed man. ”Wearing that is a good way to get shot, by somebody.” Her eyes narrowed. ”And I don't trust anybody who keeps it around with them. If you're really not with them, then prove it.” She gestured to him as he turned around, the tone of her voice indicated just how serious her next words were. ”I want to see you burn it. Until then, you'll excuse me if I keep you where I can see you.” </s>"

”Take off the uniform, and burn it.” Everything else was a blur to Jackson. Nothing the huntress, nor the other guy had said before really sunk in. But burning his uniform? It'd been almost like a security blanket, in a way. He felt safe when he had it on, although at the same time it was a huge target on his back as well. Maybe it was time to blend in with the crowd?.. Jackson eyed the woman and her Sneasel, tapping his thigh to make Houndour close in to him, making him sit at his feet. ""Why should I have to burn it? I'll just steal a new one from another dead soldier. You really want to sit here and waste that time that I'd have to undress in front of all you fine people, burn this uniform, and have to get redressed? By the time that happens, there will be Regime all over this forest. They're already on their way, no doubt, with that explosion from earlier and the heavy smoke that now rises through the skies. We have to go. There's no time for your silly games, Miss. Maybe another time, but for now, we need to move."" Jackson risked reaching back into his waistband to retrieve his pistol to which he brought forward, releasing the clip and popping the round in the chamber out. He did the same with his rifle, storing both mags into his backpack along with the pistol. He then shouldered his pack and empty rifle, whistling low for Houndour to follow.
""Kill me if you don't believe me, just don't hurt my dog. He won't hurt you unless I tell him to."" Jackson had left one thing out, but figured it didn't matter whether it was said or n [/INST] ot. He didn't fear death. It was something the Regime took from him. Jackson didn't fear much anymore, except getting caught. There was nothing but death for him no matter where he turned, and if he was to die at the hands of some wanderer, it'd be much quicker than the Regime would have done it. Slow and painful. Calling over his shoulder, he made one final remark before walking off in long strides into the North East. ""Do what you wish, but I'd hurry up and decide fast.""
Raven stood there looking between the three strangers around her, watching the supposed soldier walk off with his Houndour trotting just behind him. Electabuzz behind her was still focused on the Sneasel, his eyes slightly aglow. Raven turned to see him staring, and she gently nudged him out of his trance, walking slowly towards the soldier as she dipped her head to the girl with the sniper respectfully. ""I would assume you were the one to help me, before. Thank you, kindly. I owe you my life, in the most literal sense. If our paths ever happen to cross in the future, anything you need, I'm there.. but, I think I'll be going with him."" She jams her thumb off into the direction Jackson was beginning to disappear in the trees. ""If he is who he says he is, and he's not Regime, he seems to have made it quite far. If he is a soldier, well.. I'm pretty sure I could handle myself. Least got someone who's got my back."" Electabuzz beamed, knowing too well that Raven had meant him. She, too, smiled back at him and bowed her head to the huntress before limp-running off after Jackson, yelling a 'Hey wait up!' after him. </s>"

Interacting with: Shade (), Jackson and Raven (), Isaiah ()

The wind blowing through the treetops had stilled itself, almost as if in anticipation. Nothing moved, save the five man spec ops team silently maneuvering through the undergrowth. Lilith would've prefered a more experience team for this type of encounter, but beggars couldn't be choosers. These were the only soldiers in the area with anything beyond basic qualifications. Besides, she -well not really me, but...- had just blown an almost identical mission. She was lucky to be in a leading position as it was.
Why CO had chosen her for this was beyond her. The mission consisted of the same targets, included the same dangers, set at....the same location? Lilith held up a fist to her team, stopping them in their tracks. They haven't moved...at all? An interesting strategy, one Lilith was keen to take advantage of. It seemed they were still...working out their differences. The regime team now positioned 50 meters away had no such weaknesses. Lilith stifled a giggle, happy to finally take down another mark -with the added bonus of a few more heads. Presently, she signaled her team to begin flanking the clearing on both sides. The death of the breeze would now favor her team, as the Houndour sitting amongst the rebels likely wouldn't pick up a scent til it was too late. Lilith took it as a sign, foreshadowing her success.
While waiting for her team to take up position around the clearing, Lilith thought on the advantages her opponents had. Three of the four had a pokemon: a Sneazel, Houndour, and Electabuzz would be a great help to the rebels. Two of them obvi [/INST] ously had weapons, the others might not. It wasn't until this moment that Lilith realized...One of them is ex-regime. Not that it bothered her at all. He will recieve a traitor's death, just like the others she thought. Before she could identify the ex-soldier any further, four clicks sounded in the com she wore in her ear. The sounds indicated that all four members of her team were ready. Let the show begin! A wicked gleam shone in her eyes.
Lilith green-lighted all four soldiers HUD displays, giving them the go ahead. All at once, hell erupted around the unsuspecting group of rebels. The standard-issue Houndours kept by all four regime soldiers went to work lighting ablaze the surrounding forest. The dry wood caught almost instantly, directed by the well-trained pokemon to encircle the rebels in a wall of fire.
Simultaneously, the marksman of her team carried out special orders. He was to assassinate the ex-soldier, greatly reducing the risk of failure. Even though he didn't appear to be spec ops, most regime soldiers could fight their way out of a trap. He had the greatest chance at survival. The soldier let out his rifle's bipod, laying prone to increase his accuracy. The crosshairs of his scope leveled on the target's head. He stopped breathing, readying himself for the kick. He squeezed the trigger slowly...BANG! Before he could fire, an explosion went off in the distance. He had flinched at that, causing his shot to hit the tree behind the ex-regime man. Another truck had, at that moment, blown up.
Lilith waited to see how the rebel group would react, ready to chase after any of the nasties that managed to escape. </s>"

*Some minutes before the attack*
Isaiah dug through the wreckage, glad for the smoke and dust that still filtered through from the smoking trucks around him. He had begun to scavenge what he could, picking up three intact assault rifles, relevant ammo, two side arms, and three pokeballs, two of which were damaged and unusable. Whether pokemon were inside them was another question. The third was empty however, and Isaiah gave a silent shout in happiness as he shrunk the thing and pocketed it.
He stood up, about to leave when he heard leaves rustle. He turned, seeing a small blue mushroom thing partially hidden behind a tree. A tiny bit of blood seemed to be marking the crown of the shroom. Curiosity hit Isaiah and he headed over, kneeling to pick it, when he realized it was actually a pokemon. ""Oh, look at you, out here alone.... You were in one of these I bet..."" He motioned to one of the broken pokeballs on the ground. The ralts stared up at him, the red eyes showing under the crown of the head.
Ralts and its evolutions had a peculiar ability to sense emotions and intentions of those around them, and so this ralts knew that Isaiah wouldn't hurt her. Isaiah smiled down at the pokemon and wiped away the blood to see a moderate sized laceration that had stopped bleeding now.  ""Why don't you come with me, and we can get you patched up?""  He offered the ralts his hand, and the ralts nuzzled it gently. Isaiah then picked up the pokemon and placed [/INST] him in his hood, so that ralt's head just barely cleared the top of Isaiah's.
Just then however, all hell broke loose some yards away from him.
*During the attack*
Isaiah had a selfish thought the moment havoc erupted. He was glad he had left the group behind minutes earlier to go scavenge. He was a good 60 yards away or so, close enough to see what was happening, far enough to not be in it. Still, he couldn't hear anything after the explosion, which had happened close enough that Isaiah now had first degree burns on his face and hands.
 ""What to do, what to do...."" Isaiah mumbled to himself glancing about and shifting to get a view of the clearing. He could see two of the soldiers, the ones nearest him, advancing on the group. Only luck, smoke, and the positioning of himself and the trucks had kept them from noticing him thus far. ""Forgive me...."" Was all he said as he pulled one of the small bullpop assault rifles that had been in his backpack, the ones scavenged from the soldiers.
Isaiah slid a clip into place with a metallic click, pulled back the charging handle to load in a bullet, and pulled the trigger once, sending a bullet into the back of one soldier's head. ""Ralts, teleport!"" He yelled, still unable to hear, and therefore speaking far to loudly. Ralts did so, taking them some twenty yards into the forest, out of the line of sight of the soldiers.
Isaiah prepared to reenter the fray, a somewhat sadistic grin on his face. He was ready to kill them all....
Ralts shivered, hating the emotions coming from her new friend.... </s>"

Interactions: Jackson, Raven ()
Shade relaxed when the nameless ""soldier"" disarmed himself, but only slightly. Even as he talked, she was already moving to strip the Regime corpses of anything useful, taking care to slit the throat of each to make sure that they were dead, though she did always position herself so that she could see the man. Ammunition was her interest; any food or medical supplies they might have had was probably burning with the trucks, and more weapons would be too bulky to be practical. Besides which, she got by well enough with her bow and rifle.
She didn’t much care if he thought it was “silly” to burn the uniform, nor did she care when he did it or whether or not he was comfortable. Until he did, she sure as hell wasn’t going to trust him. Hell, she didn’t even trust the others that much either. At least the girl had clearly been a captive, the boys she didn’t know from a hole in the ground. Trust, Shade had found, was something that was almost as valuable as food and water these days. She’d come too far to end up with another knife in her back. If that upset the others, well, they didn’t have to stick around.
Seeing the girl approaching, Shade didn’t focus on her too much, continuing to loot the corpses. When she was thanked for her help, she simply grunted noncommittally. ”Says the girl who got caught once already.” Despite her words, there was no malice behind them. ”Just be careful. People lie.” If the girl wanted to risk it, that was her choice. Shade wasn’t about to tell her what to do. It was her life.
Razor was acting oddly, keeping his gaze locked on the Electabuzz. Whatever was going on between them, Shade was smart enough to stay out of it. There was a lot that people didn’t understand about Pokemon, one of the many reasons that Shade hated the Regime. They acted as though they were above the world inst [/INST] ead of part of it, that they could do however they pleased with no consequences. They destroyed everything in their path. People like that were little more than a disease, a dead thing that needed to be cut out.
The detonation of the fuel tank in one of the trucks masked the sound of the gunshot, but it was a reminder enough for Shade that it was time to leave. She had no desire to be captured; in all likelihood, she’d be shot as soon as somebody figured out that she was The Butcher. Hell, the only reason she’d made it this far with such freedom was because soldiers didn’t live long enough to report her face.
Then the forest started burning in other areas, and Shade decided it was really time to go. Razor was already moving, vanishing into the brush and undergrowth, and she was close behind the Sneasel. This was Shade’s element, the reason that she chose that moniker for the few times that she had to interact with people. Nobody could catch her in the forest. Knowing the terrain and being unpredictable were the keys, so when a stream of fire crossed her path, Shade went straight through it, covering her mouth with her sleeve.
As they were running, she saw Razor beginning to angle in the direction the girl and Regime guy had been heading, making her frown. What? No, Razor, what are you doing? Split up, you stupid Sharp Claw, don’t give them one big target to go after! Growling in anger, Shade changed course and headed east, to a deep ravine where she had been camped for the past couple of days, and where there were a few traps waiting for anyone stupid enough to pursue her.
It didn’t take long for the Sneasel to catch up to his targets, leaping from branch to branch with the lithe grace that his species was known for. He screeched and hissed to the Electabuzz, darting in and out of their path in a consistent direction that he wanted them to go. </s>"

Jackson and Raven hadn't made it far before a range of different sounds had gone suddenly gone off, one particularly a gun shot. Though it seemed to have been perfectly shot off when a truck engine behind them burst into flames, Jackson had been trained to differentiate sounds like that. The shot had lodged itself into the tree just a few feet away, and caused Jackson to turn back, but only to grab Raven by the arm and haul her forward into a bolted run. ""If we get separated, head North East towards Maine. I've heard theres a Refuge of sorts there."" Raven wasn't really focused too much on what he was saying. Her head was spinning and was suddenly feeling the need to throw up. Without warning, Raven collapsed to the ground. Jackson stopped in his tracks and looked back at the wall of fire that was closing in on them, knowing full well who [/INST] was on their tail, and for a split second he almost thought of leaving her for them. Jackson shook the thought from his head and quickly shooed Electabuzz away from her, grabbing her up and placing the unconscious girl on his shoulders, holding one leg and one arm. Raven lay limp over him in the Buddy-Carry position, Electabuzz complaining to Jackson in his ramblings with Houndour growling at him. Seemed as though Houndour was trying to tell him of Jackson's intentions, and it appeared to be working. Electabuzz followed close behind Jackson as he ran with his passed out trainer, keeping a watchful eye out when suddenly he looked up in the tree to see Sneasel. Electabuzz grabbed Jackson's pack and yanked, pointing towards Sneasel and rambled off incoherantly at him. Jackson looked up at the Pokemon and grumbled to himself, following where the Sneasel was trying to lead them. </s>"

Pleased, Razor screeched and bounded off through the trees, stopping every couple hundred feet to hang from a branch and make sure that they were following. Gradually, he led them in an easterly curve, ignoring the gunshots and the roar of the flames behind them. The forest growth became denser, sloping downhill for a bit before evening out.
When they crossed a small creek, and the fire was nothing but a large plume of smoke rising up over the trees, the Sneasel suddenly dropped out of the trees, screeching at them. Creating a pair of Ice Shards in his hands, he planted them in the gr [/INST] ound, and began leading them personally along a weaving path, no longer rushing like before but still urgent. Every so often he would plant another small Ice Shard in the ground, hissing and waving them away from it.
After a short while, he clambered back up a tree, pointed ahead of them and gave a short screech before hurrying back the way they had come.

At the bottom of the ravine, Shade was finishing up packing her things. The clatter of rocks behind her made her seize her rifle and whirl around, but she relaxed slightly when saw the Electabuzz and pair of humans. ”Didn’t fall in. Good.” </s>"
371,"<s>[INST] First Story Arc - Crosshaven
In a world that is gradually removing itself from superstition and things unnatural, the Seer is an oddity of sorts. Perhaps the Seer could be described as an old remnant of mythical times past, an oddity, an unknown that both fascinates and frightens others. Still, the legendary still exists in places and not all locations follow the path of progress so perhaps there is still room for the Seer in our lives. Still...no one really expects the Seer to look like that.
Standing only 5'5'' with black, long hair tied up in a tail on one side, and pale, translucent skin; the Seer is an oddity to behold. What compounds upon people's confusion is the fact that there is no way to tell if The Seer is male or female, a pretty boy or a beautiful girl. Usually when people first meet the Seer they try to decide what personal pronoun to attribute the Seer, as was the case with the farmer who had picked the Seer up on his way to Crosshaven.
""So erm, young man?"" The farmer asked as he was unsure if this porcelain figure sitting on the wagon seat beside him was in fact male. ""What brings a fellow like you to these parts?""
The Seer gazed back at the farmer for a moment with licorice eyes that seemed to be able to trap anyway staring back into them. The farmer was perfectly reflected in those glass-like eyes, so he felt the need to look away and back on the road. Of course the farmer was ignorant to who th [/INST] e figure beside him was, but figured it must have been someone with a decent upbringing, more so by how the Seer responded.
""We felt a shift in this area and have need to investigate. Also I know fate has guided me here for some reason, that reason should become known to me in time."" The Seer started looking around as they drove up toward the outskirts of town. The farmer really did not know what to make of his strange passenger.
""Well...if you need a place to stay should be a nice inn just up the road a ways. Any case I need to turn here so you better hop off now."" The Seer nodded once and then alighted off the seat like a feather in the wind, the black traveling cloak billowed around a bit before the Seer touched the ground.
""We thank you for your generosity, I do believe your daughter should be born shortly. Many blessing on you and your family."" The Seer smiled lightly as the stranger to the town made way toward actual population centers.
The farmer dumbfoundedly watched as the figure walked on with no further comments. ""How the hay did he know about that?"" The farmer shook it off and turned his wagon toward a dirt road that headed toward his fields. ""Still, must say I appreciate the blessin's""
The sun was high in the sky, there was quite a bit of day to burn before nightfall. The Seer knew that there was a need to be there in this small town, now just to figure out what it was before needing to journey again. </s>"

But Caboose had a job to do, he'd almost forgotten about it from the slight distractions [/INST] , his focus had returned to him when he seen the supply carriage approaching, not wanting to be late to help Caboose broke into a run towards the inn. When Caboose got to the inn he was greeted with smiles from the staff who were waiting for the carriage.

Caboose exclaimed with a fist pump in a cheerful tone as he looked to the supply carriage approaching, when it stopped Caboose would proceed to help with unloading the heavier crates full of supplies and bring them into the back of the inn. </s>"

""Nevermind. Day 737. It's a nice day and I'm still walking to a new village. I met a horse this morning, he tried to eat my paper...."" he trailed trying to think what else to write. ""I need new shoes?"" He said aloud debating whether to write it in or not. ""I...I..."", he stopped and looked up, his eyes widened but quickly darted down to the paper to write: ""I have finally made it to the new town, it's within my sights and it only took my 2 days to get here, [/INST] by foot."" He finished proud of himself. Rhys stopped and placed his entry into his bag before continuing on.
Before Rhys knew it he had finally made it to the new village. ""Crosshaven,"" Rhys said and fumbled with his bag to get his entry out to write the name down. Shoving it back into his back as quickly but gently as possible he walked further into the village looking for the nearest watering hole. Rhys was parched, he'd been travelling for 2 days and his water supply had ended early this morning. Rhys wandered the small village knowing soon he should find some place to stop but feeling tired he sat down unable to walk another step. </s>"
374,"<s>[INST] The tall amber grass swayed as Niana stalked her way through the field. She reached a clearing and slowly pushed a stalk out of the way and peered out onto the road. There was a cart. There was a farmer on that cart, as well as a man (or a woman, Niana couldn't tell). Not that it mattered. The only thing that mattered was that this person was the Seer. The Seer that people had been discussing for weeks in the town square when Niana had been watching. The Seer that would help her find those men that had killed her family. She growled at the mere thought of them, her teeth bared. She watched as the Seer got off the cart and headed in closer to the town of Crosshaven.
The feral girl retreated and sat back down amongst the grass. She closed her eyes [/INST] and listened. There was the rustling of the grass with the wind. There was the call of distant birds. There was also the steady beat of Niana's own heart. But.... there was something else. Something farther off, like the tapping of shoes on the dirt road. The Seer? She peeked out of the grass again. No it wasn't the Seer. She turned and faced the other way. Sure enough she could make out a man's silhouette. She darted back into the grass and creeped in his direction, away from the town to get a better look at him.
By the time she made it close enough to him, he had sat down. Niana also noticed he was clutching a bag. He seemed to be at ease on the road, so she figured he wasn't from around here. She clutched her bone knife and wondered what to do. </s>"
375,"<s>[INST] Argo had spent a considerable portion of his morning in the normal fashion, out amongst the hills and forests of the perimeter of Crosshaven in the pursuit of plants, herbs, roots, and all other manner of psychical remedies. His self-training in the shamanistic arts were progressive considerably. In the path few months he had begun experimenting with the effects of different plants on different sicknesses, be they animal or human, and had taken to keeping a log of his findings. Today the routine had continued to some moderate success. Some days the herbs were low to the ground, hidden amongst the grass and difficult to find. Today a few choice samples poked up from beneath the forest floor and made themselves known to them; they were collected promptly. Bag filled with the necessary items it was not even mid-morning by the time the shaman returned, retiring to his quarters near the outskirts of town.
Argo spent the rest of the morning in religious prayer and observance. He had learned the proper rites an [/INST] d rituals from passing travelers who were more than happy to pass on the information in return for mending a broken arm or healing a sick animal. Small bits of tobacco burned in an incense jar on the far side of the room; it was the only suitable leaf he could find around these parts of the world. Retiring after his hour or so of worship the shaman decided to go into town to check up on the population. As their principal healer and religious icon Argo had become an important if not truly prominent member of the community. It was during his journey into town that he caught word of the Seer's arrival.
For weeks now there had been rumors and speculation and all manner of tall tales which related the supposed powers, abilities, personality, and appearance of the legendary mystic. It was said that those who conversed with the Seer found either great or terrible fortune and so, it was with these portents in mind that Argo moved towards the center of Crosshaven with an intention of seeking the mighty mystic out. </s>"

The Niirborhood Tavern was alive with loud, hearty guffaws as Lucas Niir hit the four listeners with his punchline from behind the bar. Lucas, laughing with them, wiped away a tear, and continued washing a dirty glass. ""Let me tell you something, Lucas, those jokes won't ever get old!"" One of the listeners complimented. Lucas just shrugged. ""It's my job to keep you folks happy and full. It looks like I've done a good job of both."" Besides the four men, there were about two others sitting at two different tables. One cracked [/INST] a grin at Lucas's joke, but the other stayed stoic, watching the door intently. ""Hey, can I get you fine folks in the back anything?"" Both looked back and denied the offer.
""You got anymore good jokes, Lucas? You know I come here just for 'em!"" Lucas stepped back and placed the glass he was washing on the shelf behind him upside-down, next to a row of other sparkly clean glasses. ""Sorry boys, maybe tomorrow,"" he responded. This was met with a chorus of moans and groans from his audience, and he waved them off like flies. ""Oh come on now. I've got work to do. And hey, you guys best be getting some work in, too. These drinks ain't free, not by a long shot."" </s>"
377,"<s>[INST] As the Seer had walked along the route he had sensed a presence nearby; however it did not seem to be hostile so the Seer ignored the presence and continued toward the 'heart' of the town. The Seer could feel several pricklings down its spine, not hurtful ones, more like gentle proddings. The Seer knew what these signs meant, the fates were once again bringing some rather integral characters to the stage for another grand play. Unlike what the stories said, the Seer could not in fact control the events and information that flowed into his mind from outside his knowledge. The Seer did have visions to be sure but trying to make any sense out of them was sort of like interpreting a dream, even if the image was clear the meaning could easily escape. Thankfully the Seer had quite a bit of experience with this strange gift and therefore was quite good at figuring things out. It appeared there would be a few intersecting stories in this village that the Seer would be a part of.
The large young man unloading the supply wagon, the traveler behind him, the presence that the Seer sensed, already a few of the pieces were starting to become apparent. Course a few pieces to the puzzles were just that, pieces, the Seer would put the picture together eventually, now it was high time to get a drink and some food. The Seer looked for the nearest place to get some refreshment, it appeared 'The Niirborhood Tavern' was the place to go. The Seer idly wondered if the owner had purposefully decided to mis-spell neighborhood to make it specially or if he really thought that was the correct spelling but that was but a small mystery that did not deserve to be found out.
The Seer entered the establishment without hesitation. There was a rowdy bunch in there already it [/INST] appeared but the Seer was not bothered by some noise. From some of the conversation in the tavern it appeared the Seer's reputation had preceded the mystic. Still as was usual with such rumor one of the most important facts about the Seer was just plain ludicrous, the Seer's appearance. The usual rumors were that the Seer was a wise old man who showed wisdom on his wrinkly face, was in fact a gorgeous and well-endowed woman, or was in fact a powerful warrior that used his mighty magics to lay waste to creatures of darkness. The Seer never made any effort to correct the rumors as it allowed the magician to travel through most towns without too much trouble. Being always on the move the Seer tried not to stay too long in any one spot unless there was a reason to be and it looked like Crosshaven might just be such a place.
The Seer strode across the floor, almost making no sound when walking. The Seer made it to the bar and took a counter-seat with the men nearby. ""Barkeep a pleasure to make your acquaintance. We wish to purchase a meal and a glass of honey-wine if available."" Honey-wine a step up from most of the low end drinks but did not quite reach the levels of sophistication of the higher class, still it was not a drink a regular working man could afford very often. ""As for the meal, we shall take whatever special you recommend to travelers in order to taste Crosshaven's flavor.""
Even just sitting there and speaking the Seer gave off a distinct aura or...differentness. It was not exactly odd just different, course the Seer's looks helped tip it over to more of an oddity along with that particular way of talking. The Seer was capable of making people curious, weary, confused, and pleasant all at the same time. It really was quite a feat. </s>"
378,"<s>[INST] Arman groaned, slumping down on the seat at the front of the wagon. Rubbing her eyes, trying to clear away the bleary, fuzzy, vision. Silently she mouthed something, probably a rude word, but no sound came out. It really wasn’t fair that she had to lose her voice NOW, when they were finally at a village after traveling on the roads for so long. Sighing she flipped open her latest book of legends, that she had bargained for a few villages back. The price had been steep, and she was wary, it was probably just another book full of common fairytales. But her life was these stories and so, even knowing she was probably being conned, she had traded out three rabbits, a pigeon, and a handful of coins. The rabbits she had caught herself, and Ryan had ‘lent’ her the pigeon so he would be expecting something back. He was her ‘father figure’, the man who had picked her up all those years ago, and she had taken his name, as was costmary in some regions, Ryanson, or Ryan’s son, even though she was neither his son nor a boy. Ryan himself was driving the wagon, whistling cheerfully, to a tune in his head. Frowning Arman droned the sound out, burying her worries about her voice, and started reading from her book.

Have You H [/INST] eard?
Have You Heard?
The Seer is here!
The Seer is here!
The Seer brings Miracles!
The Seer brings Death!

Arman sighed, this poem again. There wasn’t anything wrong with the poem, actually she loved it, more than most of her stories, but as with most things, too much of something leads you to never want to encounter it again. This had been the first proper thing she had read, back when she was learning to read, piecing together the hastily scrawled words on their scrumpled piece of paper. When she had finally managed to read it, to read it all, she would then spend some time every day re-reading it, proving to herself that she could, that it wasn’t a dream. Speaking of dreams; Arman jolted awake, wincing at the sore spot where Ryan had dug in his elbow. She mouthed a curse at him, but still found she couldn’t talk. Glancing ahead she found they were at the edge of the town. Ryan stopped the horse, and Arman could hear the creak as the two other wagons behind them pulled to a halt as well. “Meet you back here, this evening, yeah?” Ryan bellowed at the other four as he hopped down from the wagon, grinning back up at Arman. “Shall we go conduct business, and see if there’s someone who can help with your voice?” </s>"
379,"<s>[INST] Lucas looked up from his audience and smiled at the young... Oh boy, I'm in for it now, Lucas thought to himself as he couldn't exactly guess what sex this newcomer was. She -or he- had long, black hair tied up in a neat ponytail, and at first sight the, this would make any sane person believe that this fellow could be a woman. But her face was so rigid and sure, unsmiling and straight that this patron could have been a man. And of course, men without ponytails weren't totally unheard of. Why, just the other day, Lucas had a man cone in who was under an occupation of a foreign name. He said he was a sam-ooh-something... Or maybe a rai-ooh-something? Oh, to Hell with it, Lucas thought.
After a fee seconds of searching for a unisexual pronoun for his customer, and a short second of hesitation, Lucas Niir smiled and nodded. ""I don't think I've had anyone ask for honey-wine in quite some time, stranger. I'll see if I have any in stock, though. And just in case you've never come in before, the name is Lucas Niir. At your service, stranger."" He greeted the mysterious fellow and turned around to exam [/INST] ine his shelves of liquor, looking around for the specified drink. He certainly stocked honey-wine, but only near festival seasons. The folks that walked in to the tavern around these parts usually favored a more ""manly"" drink.""Let's see... Hmmm... Ah, here we are!"" Lucas pulled out a bottle of unopened honey-wine, ready to serve. He started to open it immediately with one hand, searching behind him for a bottle with his other. ""Well, you're in luck. This is one of my last bottles.""
As he poured, he thought about what exactly he could make for his customer. They had a limited menu at the Niirborhood Tavern; usually the chef Lucas has hired made whatever he could make, but because of his great skill in cooking, this was usually not complained about. ""Hey, chef!"" He called to a door to his right which led to a kitchen. ""Think you can cook up a meal for me?"" With that, he set the wine glass filled with the golden wine in front of the stranger. ""Excuse me, but you're old enough to drink, right?"" With a yes, he would let go of the glass for the customer's enjoyment. ""So, what's your name, stranger?"" </s>"
380,"<s>[INST] Argo made his way quickly towards the town center, stopping to talk and converse with a few people along the way. The seer, the seer! She's in the tavern right now! No, no! It was most definitely a girl! Argo didn't wait for any further rumors, instead he sped on to his destination with all due speed. Upon approaching the front of the establishment the shaman waved hello to a couple of local customers. Although he lived on the outskirts of town his profession had made him quite well known and when he did not have the time to compose his own suppers he often came her, to the Niirborhood Tavern to get his fill. Today however he had a different sort of aim and so it was with this enthusiasm that Argo moved through the entryway.
Almost immediately the shaman was capable of picking the sage out. The. . . person, for he could not definitely tell whether it was a man or woman, released a certai [/INST] n aura which seemed to hang about them like rain clouds to mountains. Argo, more in touch with the supernatural than most, could almost visualize this aura and for the first time since he'd heard of the seer he began to have his doubts. Still, if what was said about the seer was true than his caution was heedless.
As he approached Argo caught sight also of the tavern's master, Lucas Niir. Argo was not quite friends with the man though they were assuredly acquaintances. Having been a patron of the tavern for some time Argo was sure Lucas was also privy to his usual favorites in regards to food or drink; that is to say that Argo ate food that was rather plain and preferred some alternative to drinking alcohol whenever it was available. Trying his best to contain himself, the shaman drew up a seat next to the seer, almost at a loss for where to begin. He was sure his hesitance was palpable. </s>"
381,"<s>[INST] The seer, the seer! She's in the tavern right now, Rhys heard from the locals and saw a person run by him. Rhys watched the direction that Argo ran in. ""Tarvern?"" Rhys hoarsly said attempting to get to his feet. Using all his strength he managed to get up and began to stumble his way the tavern. His head was spinning from lack of food and drink but his willpower was strong and he was determined to get to the there.
After what seemed like an eternity Rhys made it to 'The Niirborhood Tavern' feeling very relived. He stumbled through the doors and managed to make his way up t [/INST] o the counter. Breathing heavily he leant against the counter to steady himself, once he began to breath normally he opened his bag and rummaged around for his money. Looking at it with despair he looked up at the Barkeep who was serving another customer. Rhys looked like a lost child, all he could afford was water and possibly a bit of bread, if he was lucky.
The last village he visited had little work for him to do, so the money he earned did not last him very long, he had hoped the next place he visited would have more opportunities; without money Rhys could not travel. </s>"
382,"<s>[INST] Shouting caught Niana off guard. Since the Seer had arrived in the town proper there was a commotion stirring. The man she had been observing had even got up out of his sleepy reverie and rushed off towards the tavern. Perhaps it was time the girl made an appearance? Niana wrestled with the thought, a knot growing in the pit of her stomach. Would anyone remember her? Would anyone care? She shook her head and growled at the grass. She had a mission. It was for her family. She had to do it. Clutching the bone knife around her neck for good luck, Niana crouched on all four and creeped towards the town again.
She was close now. Well, closer than she had been. Closer but no less nervous. The feeling was curious to her; years of living in the wilds had made her slightly uninhibited when it came to matters of all sorts. Her clothes were an obvious one, and her emotions were an close second. Niana had all but forgotten what nervousness had felt like, along with a variety of other, more h [/INST] uman emotions. She took a deep breath and stepped out of the grass and on to the dirt road. She stood perfectly still, the gentle wind blowing her platinum hair as she stared down the tavern. Finally she began to walk towards it and finally she reached the entrance.
The Niirborhood Tavern. That's what the sign read. Or at least what Niana thought it said. It had been a while since she had done any reading, so she may have been a little rusty. Stroking the bone dagger around her neck one last time for comfort's sake, the feral girl finally entered the tavern as quiet as possible. She was immediately blasted with various pungent smells and loud noises. She winced and tried to slink off into a corner. She was used to the ambiance of the forest, and the cool natural smells of the lush life that lived there. This was almost overpowering. The closeness of the people, the roaring of laughter and chatter and the smell of a load of humans smashed into a small space made Niana want to cry. </s>"
383,"<s>[INST] While people knew the Seer was in fact in town, there was still general confusion about exactly who was the Seer as there were more than a few travelers on the road. Of course there were the clever ones, like the somewhat bashful shaman who had just taken a seat beside what he probably thought was someone akin to the man on the proverbial hill for shaman and wizards. It was rather annoying really but the Seer realized that this one had a part to play in the story at hand. The Seer sensed a few more presences that would play a part in the forming tapestry, the threads were there now it was time to string them together and then decide which branching path to take.
""Our name is of little import I am afraid but I can assure you my age is beyond the least needed for a drink that mind."" The Seer said, speaking to the barkeeper. ""Now this young man here,"" the Seer nodded in Argo's direction, ""is going to pay for my meal, aside from the honey-wine of course, I have foreseen"". The Seer was of course lying through the teeth and had not seen if the boy was going to pay for his meal because of his powers, this was simply called fabricating your own future. Still in a way the Seer was allowing Argo to feel more comfortable in talking, s [/INST] ince the boy was silent as a dead mouse.
The Seer ignored the person who had just come in to lean on the counter for the moment, a more pressing matter was at hand. The aura the Seer had noticed before on the road was now in the establishment and had a wild side to it, different from the 'wild' side of a drunk patron. It was entirely too easy to follow the source to a rather wild looking young woman who was entirely unused to civilization it seemed, not that one would consider Crosshaven exactly a huge source of civilization. The Seer locked eyes on her and motioned with eyes only, that and a look filled with authority despite the Seer's rather deadpan expression. The Seer had powers of persuasion beyond normal men, though in reality it was but a simple trick of presence that few had mastered, message did not have to be spoken to be understood though the Seer decided to speak anyway.
""Come here child we have business to discuss."" A few patrons turned their eyes curiously from the Seer to Niana, unsure of who she was or what was happening. Mostly the Seer just did not want Niana to slink off after getting a whiff of some not so great civilization, it would be better to figure out where this piece fit in the upcoming tapestry. </s>"
384,"<s>[INST] Arman trudged into the town alongside Ryan, heading for the local tavern. There was no better place to sell herbs and spices, and also the best place to ask around for the town healer. “The Niirborhood Tavern. Well they're not from my neighborhood.” Ryan joked pushing through the door, followed closely by an eye rolling Arman. Steping inside she gagged. It wasn’t like the smell was new to her, but after being on the road for so long, she had grown used to the clean air. But she would adjust, just as she always did. She followed Ryan up to the bar, where he snagged a spare seat, and she stood behind his shoulder, as usual, waiting till he gestured to a seat next to him, leaving a short gap between her and a pair of others a few stool [/INST] s over. When the barkeeper finally got to them Ryan nodded to the man, “Hello sir, can we get a drink? Two ales, please.” Arman growled silently and smacked him round the head, “Fine, fine, one ale and, …do you have any milk?” Ryan amended his request. “Also, when you aren’t busy, I’m selling herbs and spices, along with a few interesting odds and ends. Would you be interested?”
Arman was listening to every conversation, at least every one she could hear, paying attention, hunting for a story, interesting things like that. When the, was that a boy or girl?, called across the tavern to a wild looking girl skulking near the entrance, she swiveled her head, watching everything she could. Paying as much attention as her tired self could. </s>"
385,"<s>[INST] Lucas stared wide-eyed as customers poured in to his tavern. First, Argo graced the establishment with his presence, a peculiar young man who was studying medicine or something-or-other. Then, more and more came right after: about five other people in total, some from town, one who looked like a traveler, and one- Oh, Hell, what does this girl think she's wearing? For God's sake, she's in a public place!
Running a hand through his dark hair, Lucas began trying to serve each one of his new customers. Firstly, the gender-bent one who asked for honey-wine. The individual claimed that Argo would be paying for the meal, which was a little strange since he just walked in... ""Argo!"" He yelled across the noisy tavern. ""Hey, are you paying for this guy's meal?"" Lucas mentally winced as he threw out a gender-specific title, but shook it off, figuring that maybe ""guy"" would register as unisexual as well.
Lucas then looked towards the traveler, who he hadn't ever seen around town before. He looked a little lost, like a child in a crowded market. In fact, that might have been the truth, come to think of it, that might have been the case. Lucas ignored him for the moment, and two other people entered the bar: two more travelers of whom he hadn't ever seen. Before he got to them, it was time to address the skimpily dressed girl. He started to walk towards her, but stopped as [/INST] the gender-less customer called out to her. He quickly stopped the individual before he got up. ""Uhm, excuse me, you look like you two know each other,"" he gestured to the female. ""Could you tell her to cover herself up a little more properly? This is a tavern, not a brothel."" Already he began to see regulars gawking at the girl, and he rolled his eyes.
Next, a couple more travelers he hadn't seen before wandered in to the tavern. They approached the bar and took their seats. They ordered two ales originally, but one smacked the other in the back of the head and changed his order to milk. ""Alright, coming right up, you two."" He began to fill up a cup of ale and a cup of milk, listening to one give him an interesting offer. Apparently, these two strangers were salesmen, offering herbs and spices to him. ""Well, I'd be happy to buy from you two fine gentleman. I should have plenty of money to buy after today,"" Lucas agreed, gesturing to the crowd. He heard a bell ring to the right of him, and a small plate was sitting on the bar with and small sandwich and a bowl of vegetable soup. Ah, that's for... he picked up the plate and set it down where Mr. Nameless was sitting before she got up. ""One meal for the one who ordered it! You didn't give me your name!"" He pointed at those sitting around the nameless one's seat. ""If you guys touch his meal, you'll lose a finger."" </s>"
386,"<s>[INST] Niana could feel eyes on her. She could feel the gaze of many patrons drinking in her immodest visage. She had hoped to blend in, but clearly blending in with a forest and blending in with humans was an entirely different beast altogether. She pressed herself against the far wall, like a cornered cat that was hoping to slip through the wood and out into freedom. No such luck for Niana though. Someone pushed past her and she felt and drunken hand grope her chest. This was degrading. How did people live like this? She felt like she had throw [/INST] n herself into a cage. Her hand felt her bone knife and she remembered her purpose. The Seer.
As the thought made its way through Niana's mind she heard a voice call out to her from across the tavern. Wha-? The Seer's eyes locked onto Niana's own and she felt oddly calm. Not entirely at ease (she never felt she would be in this place) but her mind was at least calm for the moment. After a moment of deliberation Niana pushed herself off from the wall and slinked through the crowded tavern up until she was finally face to face with the Seer. </s>"
387,"<s>[INST] It was not even a full minute after the shaman entered that the tavern picked up its activity by a significant margin. The light grumbling and gentle laughter that had filled the place previously was now replaced with a much louder, more joyous variant. The day was dragging on and more people were coming in, though what really surprised the shaman was the way the occupancy of the tavern seemed to almost double in the span of a couple seconds. Surely this was the work of some otherworldly force, after all, was it not said that where the seer traveled many were drawn close along behind? It was Lucas, the barkeep's, voice the finally broke Argo from his revere, reminding him of other things at hand which required his attention.
""Hey, are you paying for this guy's meal?""
The shaman nodded in the affirmative, still a little slack in the jaw. He watched in silence as the seer went on to converse with a few others before finally lodging his request. ""Great seer,"" The shaman took up a rather reverent tone, as if speaking to someone who was by far his superior, ""I am [/INST] an apprentice in the shamanistic arts, though you probably knew that. I have come seeking advice and training. I wish to know all that you can teach me."" When the seer's reply was not immediately forth coming Argo allowed himself to at least take stock of the newer members of the bar, in particularly the crudely dressed woman near the back of the room. He recognized her from his work in the fields and with herbs, often caught glimpses. Still, he'd not really bothered to give her much interest until now. She was so out of place?
Gazing back again at the seer to see if they would grant his request the shaman found again, sadly that it had not spoken. Assumedly it was more interested in its sandwich and honeywine at the moment. Still, it would give Argo a chance to run damage control, especially after Lucas' latest request to 'tell her to cover herself up a little more properly'? Rising, the shaman-in-training made his way over to the scantily-clad female, removing his light poncho which he then offered to her. ""It would probably be best to cover yourself, miss."" </s>"
388,"<s>[INST] The Seer had gotten the wild one's attention and soon they were face to face. Her appearance did not bother the Seer in the slightest but many of the others were quite taken aback by her appearance, even calling her a 'whore'. The Seer now had a few things to juggle: food, those around the Seer, and of course the honey-wine. The Seer kept Niana in that mystical gaze and somehow managed to also procure half a sandwich and a glass of honey-wine. The Seer also had an adoring fan in the next seat who decided to go ahead an offer the girl a poncho for herself. The poor thing looked healthy but she was quite out of sorts in this environment, still, the Seer appreciated the help from the side.
The barkeep was a bit miffed at her appearance but he would have no complaints after what the Seer did next. The Seer took the poncho from the young shaman's hands and instantly put the garment o [/INST] n her. ""Alright young one, I have at least an idea as to why you are here. For now do not leave my side until I have heard the story."" The Seer commanded quite sternly, getting down to business. ""As for you young shaman,"" The Seer finally acknowledged the young man who wished to learn all the secrets the Seer had, ""keep your eyes and ears open. Observe and you may learn something."" The Seer then took a quick break to down some food and drink.
""As I am currently dining by all means explain your request in full. By coming to us, you have interwoven your life's thread with several others in this room for a span. Now speak."" It was impossible for Niana to back out now, her fate was interwoven with that of the Seer since she entered the Tavern.
Almost as an afterthought the Seer reached inside it's garments and produced the necessary coin for the drink and placed them on the counter. </s>"
389,"<s>[INST] When they received their drinks Ryan placed a couple of coins on the bar.
He called me a gentleman, a gentleman! Arman sniggered silently to Ryan, Oh that’s a good one, you’re a gentleman, you! That was too funny, them gentlemen? Oh, and she collapsed into silent laughter again, with Ryan gently thwacking her ear, to get her to stop. Pulling herself together, Arman stopped laughing and instead watched the scene further along the bar play out in front of her. Good material for [/INST] a story if ever there was some. The wild girl, with very little clothes, was interesting for a start, and the person who had called out to her, Arman had long since given up trying to decide on a gender, was certainly quite a piece. The boy who offered the cloak like thing was also worth mentioning. Basically, Arman found the whole situation interesting. She took a swig of her milk, gulping it down. For now she was content to watch. But later, maybe, she might, might, jump in. </s>"
390,"<s>[INST] *Thunk!* splinters were sent flying as the two pieces of wood cluttered to the ground. Hefting the ax onto his shoulder with a small grunt, Fredrick wiped his brow with his other hand, taking a brief moment to scowl through the harsh light at the fields of golden wheat gently swaying in the breeze. He heaved a sigh as the gentle winds washed over him, cooling his body down from the work he was doing behind the homestead.
""Fredrick!? Fredrick my dear boy!"" a familiar voice called out.
Samuel Louis the farmer appeared around the side of house, moving quite quickly for a man with a fixed limp, his weathered face was bright red, which Fredrick could only assume wasn't from hard work out in the fields, with the stench of whiskey that hung about him.
""There you are lad. I have some news that may be of interest to ya, do you care to hear it?"" He asked with a toothy grin, despite his worn appearance and habit of drinking away his savings, Samuel was a good man and a deceptively robust character.
""I know you have a penchant for gossiping, so I fear I'll hear this news regardless."" Fredrick replied jokingly, swinging the ax down into the stump with hearty thump, where he had been cutting this afternoons wood.
The whiskers on Samuel's face seemed to bristle at the notion that his companion cared not for his tale, which he had so selflessly stopped his evening ritual to deliver. ""So I suppose ye' don't care that there's a rumor that the legendary seer is in town."" He sa [/INST] id, trying to hide a grin as he waited for the young lads reception to the news.
Fredrick's face became fixed with a determined look as he immediately moved with a purpose, quickly tossing the two bits of wood into the pile, before rushing over to the back of the wagon where he placed his coat and sword while he worked.
""Forgive me Samuel, I'll need to borrow Killigan if I'm to see if this rumor is true."" He said, not actually waiting for confirmation from Sam. The old man blinked in surprise as the lad bustled past him into the stable, before emerging moments later, leading his old grey gelding toward the front of the house.
""N-now, just hold on a second, I-I thin.."" He stammered, but was cut short as Fredrick vaulted into the saddle and tossed him a small leather bag.
""That there is for Killigan, I do hope it's enough."" He said, as the old farmer, stared bewildered at the golden light glinting from the bag. That had been the sum of his fortune that had survived the journey from his home land, he had hoped to use it to buy passage with some travelling merchants, but those few who did pass through the small town knew nothing of the name he gave them, he now hoped that it would help the old farmer retire for good.
Wild thoughts and stray memories swirled about his head 'The seer, a being that appeared in both his peoples and this lands stories of yore, here, in Crosshaven?'
Fredrick just had to know, spurring his heels into Killigan, he raced off toward town. </s>"
391,"<s>[INST] Names were being thrown at her as she stood in front of the Seer. ""Whore!"" one called out, ""Put some damn clothes on you tart!"" another slurred. Niana turned and hissed. Force of habit. A poncho was offered to her by a man next to the Seer. Niana shook her head but didn't say anything (although it's not like talking would come easily for her, years of solitude and no one to speak with will do that to a person.) As quick as a forest cat the Seer snatched the poncho and draped it over Niana, who squirmed and was obviously discomforted by the sudden covering of her body. The Seer began to speak, he or she commanded quite sternly that Niana not leave his or her side until their appointed strand of interwoven fate was unwound. The feral girl's eyes shifted uneasily to the Shaman biding his time at the side of the Seer.
Suddenly, a command that made her blink in s [/INST] urprise. ""Now speak."" The Seer had said. The words were there, floating in her head, filed ever since she had first heard of the seer coming along. My family was murdered and I need help finding those responsible is what she wanted to say, but it was like there was a disconnect from her brain to her mouth. She focused herself. Her human voice came out, forming words as a child might, just learning to speak. ""F-fam-ily.."" She rasped, ""Murdered..."" It was all she could say. Painful memories flooded back. Ones she had been suppressing for so long. The faces of her family, her sister, her mother, her father all floated in her mind like three hot brands. Angry tears welled up in her eyes, full of emotion, raw like someone who had never learned to cage their inner feelings. Though tears added a gleam to her tanned skin, she did not break eye contact with the Seer. </s>"
392,"<s>[INST] F-fam-ily. . . murdered. . .
The shaman watched with some measure of interest as the Seer worked its magical power. It was strange. Though this wild-woman and the seer had just met already the power of that mystic seemed to be subduing her. With a simple worded command the dark-skinned woman was brought to the verge of tears, then, at the explanation of their source they fell unreservedly.
The whole scene was more than shocking; had the seer known these things would happen? Why else would it be here? It must has known, through some intuitive power, that the people of Crosshaven had been in need of its guidance. Truly the shaman was left in a state of perpetual awe. But then the realization of the situation hit, the gravity. If what the wild-woman said was true then that mig [/INST] ht mean there were still such men within the village' confines. Foremost as a healer the shaman had an interest not only in the welfare of the village but also its safety. There was no way of telling how long ago the murders had happened.
Argo longed to speak up, to question the woman, to find out the truth. Instead he remained silent. The way her tears fell, he felt that saying something might only causing further harm.
He would do as the seer had instructed, he would watch and wait, listen and learn. Although he was distressed by the pain of the wild-woman there was really nothing he could do for her, he did not know her or anything about her. No. The best course of action would be to see what the seer did, to follow its advice and pray to the gods for a positive outcome. </s>"
393,"<s>[INST] Lucas scooped up the various coins placed on the counter while scrambling to pour drinks for all who asked. All the while he was carefully watching the bar around him for anyone who was more rowdy than he cared for. For a more or less packed tavern, things seemed alright. Thankfully, the nameless fellow had taken a poncho and threw it over the skimpily dressed woman, people nodding in appreciation around her. One of the two merchants looked like he was trying to hold back laughter while the other looked upon him disprovingly.
As conversations swept through the bar, finally it seemed, Lucas knew why so many people had flocked to the Niirborhood Tavern. Apparently, The Seer had wandered in to town, and more than tha [/INST] t, right in to Lucas's own tavern. Lucas himself rolled his eyes at this, thinking that the people of Crosshaven had a little more sense than that. The Seer was a story, that's all it was. No one like that could ever exist.
As Lucas continued to look around the tavern, he noticed the white haired girl was making a fuss, crying and looking very upset. Argo was also not looking very well either. Between them, the nameless fellow stood, emotionless as ever. Lucas frowned slightly and decided to incestigate. He shuffled down the bar, serving drinks as he went. ""Excuse me, Argo!"" He leaned over the bar and called over the other noisy voices to the only person he really knew in the group. ""Everything alright over there?"" </s>"
394,"<s>[INST] Rhys looked to the bar seat beside him and slowly pulled himself up to sit on it. He watched the barkeep attempting to catch his eye but to no avail. He was tired and very hungry but he had to keep writing in case he missed something important. Pulling out the same sheet of paper from earlier he continued to write.
'Made it to the village of CrossHaven and found a tavern which many people seemed to rush to. There may be something big going on here. Could I be in the middle of something wonderful? Trying to order some food and drink and then will attempt to find lodgings. There are many strange people here, all of them are so different and I hope to make more new friends, if I make it...just a jest...or not'
Rhys chuckled to himself, he knew no one else would read these entries so he made funny jokes to himself for when he would read them back l [/INST] ater in life. Rhys began to think, what would he do with all these entries, he had over 700 entries each as meaningless as the last. They were everyday things where nothing exciting happened, sure it was fun to write them but would they be fun and full of memories when he read them back. Rhys needed some adventurous events to happen to make it more interesting, to make him more interesting. He was a traveller with a boring life. Last week his was in a lively village and what did he do, spent most of the days sweeping a shop floor, cleaning in a tavern and grooming horses. Sure it was his way of earning money to travel but what if he found a job that was more exciting and actually involved interacting with people or something more meaningful, just something better to write in his entries so he wouldn't feel like he left his old life for nothing. </s>"
395,"<s>[INST] The Seer appeared...disappointed as the mystic looked into the girl's eyes. Having gleaned all the information that was necessary from her eyes the Seer turned from her to focus on finishing eating and drinking. ""Revenge is it...not a motive we have any high regard for, all that breeds is hatred and malice."" The Seer took another large drink of the honey-wine and smacked its lips a few times in contentment. ""Despite these misgivings, fate has dictated this meeting and we shall see this through."" The Seer reached into its cloak and brought forth a spool of white thread and unraveled a strand about a yard in length and cut it off with a fingernail of all things.
""Thread of Fate
Reveal the path to take
Connect the strands [/INST] Reveal the plan
Decide our fates
Before time dictates""
The Seer repeated this chant as fingers danced across the thread, leaving behind bows, loops, and knots as they went on. Soon the long strand was now looking quite irratic and utterly random. By the end there were three distinct segments that could be seen, one had more knots than anything else, the second had several bows and frayed edges, the third had a single loop and the just ended abruptly, the end torn off and broken. The Seer stared at the separate segments with a thoughtful expression, then handed it over to the young shaman. ""So which of these three paths would you take?"" The Seer asked and continued to finish the meal which was almost gone at this point. </s>"
396,"<s>[INST] Taking the spool reverently from the Seer, Argo did his best to try and discern the differences between the three threads. He'd had some practice in the arts of scrying, though his ineptitude in such matters was plain before him now. To him the spools seemed to represent different paths, each one twisting and entwining itself to the others, each contributing towards a common, if confused, mass. ""Forgive me Seer, but I can draw nothing of importance from it. These strands seem to represent the lives of various people, though how they interact and what will become of them I cannot say."" In a way, Argo felt that he [/INST] was already failing. Something as simple as this first task had clearly shown his training to be not up to the task at hand. Still, he couldn't let that deter him from future venture.
Twisting over the massed threads in his hands, Argo's eyes once again turned to the fellow mystic, offering a question. ""If the Seer does not mind, I would like to know what they think of it?"" The shaman's hands offered the twisted web of threads back, fingers guiding the clump back onto the table before the Seer. Perhaps if he knew something of the Seer's methods it would be easier to determine the proper way to answer the problem. </s>"

A fresh tide of tears came out and made their way down her already wet cheeks. Her family would never rest in peace it seemed. Their souls would be doomed to wander restlessly, justice eluding them. The feral girl wanted to storm out of the stupid human building [/INST] and go running off into the wild, where she truly belonged; but for some reason she remained in front of the Seer who was doing some magic with a string. Not that Niana could understand any of it. She looked at the man next to the Seer. He smelled of herbs and spices. Some sort of shaman perhaps? It didn't matter. Niana grasped her knife around her neck with both hands and shut her eyes, trying to stem the tide of tears. </s>"
398,"<s>[INST] A cloud of dust began to settle over the cobbled path as Fredrick came to a halt outside the stables, the groom whom was a young boy by the looks of things, stared dejectedly off into space.
""Boy. See to it that my horse is stabled and fed."" He commanded, dismounting from his horse fluidly, handing the boy the reigns and a couple of coppers, before quickly pushing passed him to get to the tavern entrance. The young fellow sneered at his back, and spat on floor, somewhat disgruntled from being awoken from his daydream, but Fredrick paid him no mind.
He had quickly heard talk of the seers location, and so had half of the town supposedly from the din of noise that was coming from within, carefully he opened the doorway and pushed his way through a group of people that had amassed around one of the tables. Many eyed the sword on his hip suspiciously, others went so far as to challenge him with disapproving stares, it wasn't common for a man to walk around armed in a small town like this, and had this been some other day he might of even taught a few of them some lessons in respect, but no, his mind was focused solely on the seer. And if it isn't the seer? The q [/INST] uestion skittered across his thoughts. Perhaps just some pretender? Another one suggested, color rose up his neck at the remembrance of his haste, a flaw that his master had once said would be the death of him. Pausing for a second behind the last wall of onlookers, he pushed forward, quickly taking in the scene before him.
An odd girl, scantily dressed, beside the poncho she wore, stood before the table. Her eyes tightly shut, perhaps hiding from the looks she was earning from some of the patrons, looks that were far more threatening than any his sword had received. Her odd dress style at least drew eyes away from his own. The young town shaman was contemplating pieces of thread in front of a stranger, confusion painted across his face, as he offered them back.  So this was the supposed seer, doesn't look like much. He wondered, crossing his arms across his chest, he decided to watch and contemplate his next move.  Oh wouldn't you be proud Master. Here I am finally exerting patience and careful thought. He thought bitterly as he waited for the supposed seers reaction, doubt held reservation in his mind and he was beginning to regret having acted on a rumor. </s>"
399,"<s>[INST] The Seer stared blankly at Argo for a moment, then suppressed a small chuckle. ""Well you're honest I'll give you that."" The Seer picked up the mess of thread and waved it around for a moment. ""You know what these mean?"" The Seer pointed at several different locations seemingly at random. ""Absolutely nothing! We literally just made up that bunch of hogwash to see if you had an ounce of brains in ya! If you had tried to figure out some deeper meaning from this batch of worthlessness we would have booted you out for being a fraud. Still, you did at least guess at the meaning we were trying to convey."" The seer then unraveled the thread on a whim, somehow managed to get rid of all the loops, knots, and even frayed edges making the thread completely whole again, back on the spool in the Seer's cloak.
""As for you girl, stop being on the verge of tears!"" The Seer turned back to Niana with great purpose, as her eyes had been closed that allowed the Seer to lightly pinch the young woman's cheeks between it's thumbs and forefingers and gave her face a quick stretch and suddenly had hands to the side as if nothing had happened. ""Just because we do not personally approve does not mean I won't help. In any event they should be brought to justice, in that fact you will find no argument from us; however we do have more pressing matters that may take my attention from the task of tracking them down. Also be thankful that your thread of fate just so happens to coincide wit [/INST] h one we need to follow."" The Seer then glared at one of the newest onlookers who happened to be Fredrick.
""That look of careful examination does not suit you."" Then the Seer made a parting motion to the crowd. ""Make way, we already have what we came here for."" He/She was going to take a step toward the exit and into the crowd when the Seer turned around to make sure the food and drink had been finished. Seeing that it had all been devoured and paid for, the Seer said ""our compliments for the food and honey-wine"", took Niana by the wrist in a firm but gentle grip, then promptly stepped into the crowd. It was a curious thing that happened next, those in front of the Seer just felt the need to step out of the way as soon as the Seer was near them. A few tried to resist but did not try hard enough and before the Seer could plow into any of them they stepped out of the way. It was kind of like seeing a magnet that repels metal being pushed through sand. Those who nearby felt like the Seer should just not be touched, those that tried to touch Niana as they passed suddenly felt as if an icicle was pressed against their spine and that shock and sudden fear made sure she was safe.
""If you are coming then come,"" the Seer directed this to Argo and Frederick, not through sight but a sort of voice projection. ""Otherwise go back to your ales and beers. We are quite busy."" Before two more shakes of a stick they had already made their way out the door and into the street. </s>"
400,"<s>[INST] Lilliannah stopped a moment. She had been traveling for three straight days without rest, and it started to wear on her. She pulled back her hood just enough so the breeze could make its way past her forehead. Wiping the sweat from her brow, she took a deep breath. ""Finally, I'm here"", she muttered softly.
Despite the hot sun beating down on her, she was covered from head to toe. Her dark brown tunic seemed to be made of a fine cotton cloth, sturdy leather padding on her elbows and shoulders. Heavy, black leather bracers covered her forearms up to her elbows. Plain, dark brown cloth pants are held up by a black leather belt, matching her bracers, and lined with a few pouches and other oddities. Brown leather boots, a shade or two lighter than the rest of her clothing, reached just past her knees, straps and buckles folding the leather over on the outside, secured them in place. Fixing her hood to cover more of her face, she continued towards the town.
It was late afternoon. The sun would set soon, perhaps an hour or so, casting shades of orange and red over the fields. It was her favorite time of day, for a few reasons. She would make it in just in time for supper. Food an [/INST] d a comfortable bed would make for a nice way to end this long and tiring journey. Crosshaven, it was called. Quaint and quiet so far. Farmers looked to be finishing up their daily chores in the fields as she passed. Families filing into their houses for dinner.
Stopping near some gossiping street loiterers, she asked where the nearest tavern was. ""The Niirborhood Tavern"", they replied happily enough, ""just a little ways more up the road, you won't miss it"". They quickly returned to their gossiping, which Lilli heard a bit of before she turned to continue in the direction of the tavern. Talk about the 'seer' made her snicker. ""It's all just a bunch of hocus pocus"", she muttered again, low enough that the loiterers wouldn't hear, I'm sure just another fraud, or perhaps even nothing at all. Though as she neared the tavern, goose bumps ran down her arm, a chill up her spine, her stomach turned. She pulled her hood just a bit farther over her eyes. She stopped a few yards before the door and took a deep breath. I'm being silly she thought to herself. Her intention was to continue into the tavern, get some food, a hard drink to settle her stomach and a good nights rest finally. </s>"
401,"<s>[INST] Arman knew what she was doing was wrong, but that didn't mean she was going to stop. She had been an interested watcher of the episode in the tavern, since Ray wouldn't need her till this evening, so she had decided to follow along behind. A good story to be gained? She was so there.
Ray had once said she thought way too much about stories; her every waking thought, when not about food, was stories. Sure, she was probably being just a little over-focused on the one subject, but that was how she worked. No way around it. When the genderless 'kid', whom the other boy had [/INST] called ""Seer"", had started heading out holding the girl she lept off her stool and scuttled out the door ahead of the small party. Striding away from the tavern she tried to look confident, like she was doing nothing wrong. She slipped into a small alley across the street from the tavern, waiting to see where the others went. Hoping she wasn't being stupid, was this crazy? yes probably. Should she be doing it? No probably not. But none of that was going to stop her. This was the most exiting thing that had happened for a long time there was no way she was missing out. </s>"
402,"<s>[INST] Lucas sighed as Argo ignored him, watching the nameless one leave with Near-Nudey Judy in tow. The one pulling the wild girl offered for anyone else to follow them, and although he felt a gravity of interest towards the curious personality, the tavern was packed, and somebody had to run it. A new woman entered as the two were leaving. This girl was dressed head to toe in a dark tunic, pulling a hood over her head as she entered. Lucas managed to get a look at her face before it came in: She had beautiful red hair and bright blue eyes.
Those same eyes seemed to be cast in Lucas's direction. He smiled at the new woman and motioned her o [/INST] ver to the bar for a drink. As he did, he smoothly swept up coin left on the counter, replacing some with various drinks, poured and mixed at a brisk pace. As he served his eager customers, he caught sight of one of the salesmen getting up to leave. Lucas quickly made his way to the other one to inquire. ""Your colleague's seems interested in that fellow, huh?"" He asked. Before he waited for an answer, he shot down the topic and decided to talk about business. There was a short gap of time for him to talk, most of the tavern-goers plate's and glass's filled. ""So, you two are spice salesmen, hm? What have you got in stock, my good man?"" </s>"
403,"<s>[INST] Fredrick ran the ball of his thumb against the hilt of his sword in quiet contemplation. He had felt... something. A sudden shift in his soul as the Seer took their leave of the tavern, was this what it felt like to be called by fate? And yet he found himself frozen, affixed to the floorboards beneath him, the last remainders of his doubt crippling him in it's attempt to steer his course away from this strange figure. His foot crept slowly ahead of him, soon followed by the other, as he reeled forward like a drunkard, just managing to catch his step before he collided with the newly entered patron.
""My apologies,... madam."" He managed with a quick half bow, swiftly moving toward the door, throwing his shoulder into it as he burst out into the street.
The Seer and the girl with the look of the wild about her, were but feet ahead. A being of legend, [/INST] naught but a few feet in front of him. Oh, how his old friend Simeon 'Lucky fingers' would have killed to be in his place. That fool had always thought himself destined for great things, it was a shame that he wound up with his own blade through his heart as Fredrick had pried it away from those, what turned out to be, not so lucky fingers. He blinked away the memory, before turning his gaze on the Seer, dealing with them would be as dangerous as dueling with Simeon had been that day.
""And what part do I play into all of this?"" He asked carefully after them, as another question burned in the back of his mind, begging to be voiced. Ask nothing of the seer, owe nothing. He reminded himself soothingly, fixing his face with the placid stare that he wore ever so well when at court. Far better than a look of careful examination. He thought begrudgingly. </s>"
404,"<s>[INST] Though Lilli didn't know it, she had passed the Seer on her way into the tavern. Her pale blue eyes glittered as she walked through the sunlight, her gaze was fixed on the ground in front of her, never looking away. Whether she caught the groups attention or not, she didn't notice, nor did she much care. She wasn't here to start trouble or attract any attention. All she wanted was to do was settle the grumbles of her stomach and the aches in her feet. Everything else could come later, if it was to be.
The tavern was bustling with business. And apparently the recently departed group had caused a bit of a stir. One man nearly plowed right into her as he tried to catch up with them. It took a moment for her to get her bearings, her gaze lingering over the crowd for a moment, taking in the many different people enjoying the the company of the tavern and its goods. Finally, her eyes settled on the bar keep and an empty spot at the bar. He motioned her over.
She slowly made her way through the crowd and to the empty seat. The bartender seemed to be busy with other patrons of the busy establishment. Was [/INST] he here by himself?, she thought, and glanced around the tavern hoping to see someone else who looked to be working here. To no avail, the gentleman helping the salesman was the only one about. She tugged at her hood, pulling it off her head and released her braid from the confines of her cowl that now draped over her shoulders. She already knew what she wanted, but she couldn't help but gaze over the backdrop of liquors behind the bar. This place must be doing well for itself, she murmured, her gaze floating over to the bartender once more. She was hungry, her rations had ran out about a day and a half ago. A strange sound crept from her stomach, like the growling of a hungry beast. It didn't matter what they served here, she was hungry enough to eat nearly anything they had, and probably everything on their menu.
Her calloused hands sat gently, folded on the hard surface of the bar top. She could be a patient women if she had to be. Business came first, it always came first. Her face turned sour as a thought crossed her mind. A yawn escaped her, with it, the sour disposition quickly disappeared. </s>"
405,"<s>[INST] Indeed, The Seer responded rather indifferently to Frederick's question about what part he would play in the upcoming events, ""that is a question worth asking. We have not the slightest clue except that we know you will play your part."" The Seer turned to its rather motley crew and blew a strand of hair out of way. ""My senses tell me that we should find the answers by following the murderer's trail, of course a lead is needed in order to start this venture. As the brigands got away without any trouble all those years ago no doubt they have become complacent and la [/INST] x. Still they are not stupid if they have yet to be caught so the best course of action is to find the middle man, the person who helped coordinate their movements in the past by providing information.""
The Seer said all this with absolute certainty, as if because it was said it was so. ""Now to aid in the search, if the young miss perhaps has a token, a remnant from the attack, we can use the item to attempt a path finding. It is not guaranteed to work of course but could provide us a valuable lead. Otherwise some old-fashioned investigative work will be in order."" </s>"

This is what happens when chaos' natural enemy, order, arises. Order among chaos usually resolves chaos. Who knows what'll happen when this glint of hope attracts more. Will they sit in the center, dissipating the surrounding chaos? Or will it dissolve and scatter among the chaos, never to be seen again?
Roman Torchwick
Roman orders some of his men in. ""Alright, boys. It's time for a lockdown. I mean every man, woman, and child inside. Head count, and report back. And be sure to check the old base. I don't want any of our... feral brothers hiding out there. If they can't afford to live here, they can leave. Assuming they find an exit that isn't blocked by us or Grimm."" Remembering the White Fang members who occasionally inhabit these halls, Roman was sure to be careful not to insult the fleabags. He was cruel, not dumb.
""Yes, boss."" The soldier replies, as he and the others gathered exit the now-emptied Beacon Academy in the aircrafts they had gotten used to. ""Man, it's good being king."" Roman says to himself. After a few seconds of silence, he says aloud ""I know we can't find more hunters. That's what we're doing here at Beacon: training great hunters. To work for us."" A few more seconds of silence pass. ""Yeah, yeah. They need Aura. I know, but we're doing the best we can. Scooping up every window licker with a certain glow about 'em. We-""
At that, the doors burst open again, revealing a slim frame. Feminine curves, but not long hair. The glare keeps her out of sight. ""I might have news you want. Master."" Roman knew the voice. Very well. The voice from the woman glided through the air, as though they were made of silk. The redheaded leader smirks and tells she-who-has-been-away-for-far-too-long ""well let's hear it, baby doll."" At the remark, the woman sets down a scroll and walks out, saying ""that's the message. Don't sniff it for my scent too long, darling."" Roman, now annoyed, yet with a slight bump in the crotch of his pants, walks over, picks up the bottle, and [/INST] walks to his chambers, saying only ""I think we've found it.""
Magdeline
Magdeline has been outside observing all this, but she couldn't hear anything after the soldiers left. If only sound bugs could crawl. She was only able to see Roman talking, but nobody else in the room. Until that lady came in. She wasn't there long enough to get a good look, but her body language was very responsive to Roman. Maybe a lover? Interested coworker? No clue, but what she did know was there was a scroll in Roman's possesion now. And from the dictator's face, it couldn't have been good news for the Uprising. Saying nothing, she deactivates her bug, catching blips of soldiers telling people to get in their houses and... things much worse than that.
Once back at the base, in the middle of the industrial district's underground, Magdeline reveals what she knows to her team. ""We need to figure out what they're planning with that scroll, could one of you be a dear and get some more information on scrolls, probably those dealing with power, if I know Roman well enough. And I'm sure I do. Now, since they're starting a curfew, we need to be extra careful when we plan meetings later in the day. If we make a night time meeting, use rooftops or underground if you can. If you must use ground level, take back roads. I'd rather you be late than dead. Hear me?"" She asks her final question with tears starting to well up. Dammit, I can't keep going to the past. I need to focus on here, now, and these kids that need help. Taking a deep breath and wiping her eyes, Magdeline continues. ""Now, I've done some scouting about the patrols, and I've marked them on the boards. The red dots are where they start and are at the top of the hour. avoid the lines as much as you can. If you need somewhere to stay after a meeting, you're more than welcome to stay at my house, but you'll have to be careful not to mess up the morning head count. Know the patrols. Be safe. I love you all. Now get home and get some rest. Avoid fighting. Next meeting: same time, same place, exactly one week. I'll find a hole in their defence for us to pounce on."" </s>"
407,"<s>[INST] Silme Raana
""Yeah, yeah, I'll see what I can scrounge up, but do,remember it'll cost you if I have to pay for this information, Mags.""Silme was in a chair, wearing his regular hooded cloak and leather rogue wear, fiddling with a helmet he was working on. It had taken him a while, but he finally finished it, a masked helmet shaped like the mask of a Beowolf, a great way to inspire fear in his enemies. He'd even made so that the eyes glow ominously, with one being a bright silver and the other being a dark, scarlet red. After doing a final check of everything, he folded down his ears and put the mask portion over his face, a lot of metal plates moving into place to make the helmet portion of the gear, a perfect fit. After some more fiddling, he activated the communication piece and eye glow, turning to his partner in crime as he got up.
""Sapphire,"" he began, his voice purposely distorted by the mask to make it sound deeper and more bestial, ""I'm going on by myself, going to check some things out, don't wait up for me, just head straight home and be careful. I'll be home as soon as I can. As for the rest of you, try not to die, meatsticks."" With that, he left the room, picking up Scarlet Ravager as he did so. Contrary to the name, the claws were actually a dark, non-reflective black, the glow of the Dust cartridges being hidden by the cartridge cover. The name came from what they looked like after a fight, as well the state they left their victims when he really got into a fight.
Exiting the hideout as quietly as possible, he found himself in a back alley, trash everywhere and the smell of human waste and decay was too much, especially for his heightened Faunus senses. The helmet helped block them out, if only a little, as he made his way through the alley until he came to a ladder that led to the rooftop. He waited until he got to the very top of the roof before he dug into his weapon, pulling out a scroll of paper with a snarky smile, opening it up to look over the contents. Convoy routes for Dust shipments being sent through the city. . . Jackpot. Thank you Mags, now comes the easy bit, taking it from Torchprick's goons.
Picking the least guarded convoy, Silme put away the scroll in his pack and equipped his weapon, the claw part being pulled back to allow ease of using his hands as he began his sprint over the city, silenty making his way towards the nearest junction where the convoy was stopping to pick up some more Dust, then they'd leave to join another convoy. He soon arrived at the rest area, just as the convoy stopped at the junction. It was composed of a single truck, one Mech suit, and about a dozen pieces of cannon fodder. This was going to be like taking candy from a baby.
He waited until half the group went into the target Dust shop to 'convince' the owner to part with some Dust for the cause, then he jumped down an alkey, watching from the shadows as one of the men came close to the opening. His hands shot out of the darkness, grabbing him,by his head and snapping his neck with a quick, brutal twist before dragging him into the alley. Then the massacre began, as he stealthily moved around thegroup, who were stupidly over-confident, not to mention slow. It wasn't until he had gone through half of the guys outside that they got on that something was up. The mech driver, sensing something a miss, scrambled back into his suit after having decidednto take a leak break on the sidewalk. Goddamit man, you're a faunus not an animal, just hold it. That guy was going down first, Silme was to pissed off at him to attack anyone else.
Sprinting out into the open from a different alley, he channeled his Sembalance into his claws, causing them to flip up andover his outstretched hands, a trail of reddish-silver following him as he reached the mech leg. He pressed a butyon in the gauntlet, spinning the cartridge holder until it hit Ice, before he struck out a viscous cross-slash at his target, causing a reddish silver ice to spread ober the entire limb and even to the main chasis, the addition of his Sembalance makin [/INST] g the ice extremely caustic, the metal appendage already beginning to creak as the load it bore started to become more than it could take. Unaware of this, the mech turned to fire at him with it's light machine guns, but he was already gone, charging the 3 goon who had seemed to finally come to their senses as they all open fire on Silme with their assault rifles. Switching to wind Dust now, jumped into the air and began to spin around violently, causing a tornado of acidic winds to form arpund him as he fell towards the group, their bullets being corroded into dust before they even reached him.
He crashed into them, the winds burning their eyes and leaving them defenseless to his next attack. He stabbed his right claw forward into one of them, then pulled it out through the side, sending pieces of the soldier everywhere. His next victim was to be used as a human shield as the Mech open fire on him, he grabbed one of the blinded men and pulled him in front to take the brunt of the onslaught and his aura barrier deflected whated ever got through him. The Mech advanced quickly, still firing as he moved bacwards, his cover being blown away piece by bloody piece as he waited for the right moment to strike. Suddenly, the Mech stumbled a bit as its frozen leg broke open, revealing the vulnerable joints that keeps the thing stable.
Jackpot! Silme thought with a grin under his mask as he shifted his free claw into it's SMG mide and the Dust cartridge to Fire, turning the bullets into tiny explosive as he blasted the weakspot witg a barrage of burst-fire until the leg broke, causing the Mech to fall over with a crash. Turning to the store front, mutilated corpse still in hand, he reloaded the clip and open fire on the final goons he needed dead, mowing them down as they exited the store, the doorframe creating the perfect little bottleneck for his piercing bullets to eviscerate them. He stopoed firing only when the final man fell to the ground, before turning towards the surviving member, who was frozen in fear and had ckearly wet himself. Silme looked like a hungering demon with the corpse in his hands and the heterochromic red and silver of his eyes, piercing into the man's soul.
""Get in the truck and drive us to the Loner Zone, I'll be in back where the cargo is, and remember, I'll know where we're headed, and if you deviate just the slightest bit, you'll end up like your buddies over there, so get moving.""Silme dropped the corpse and walked over to the Mech just as the pilot pops out, only to find himself looking down the barrel of Scarlet Ravager.
""End of the line for me, huh."" He stated, unusually calm given the circumstances.
""Sorry,"" Silme responded, surprised to find that he trul meant it. Didn't stop him pulling the trigger, though.The White Fang had stripped him of his mercy a long time ago. ""But with the life we chose, one is rarely assured a gentle death."" He finushed quietly, staring at the man's corpse for a momentbefore turni g to the last one alive. ""Did I stutter before, get in the fucking truck.""
Fearfully, the man sprung inyo action, not even thinking of radioing back for fear of what might happen to him. Silme,using Corrosion and vials of Fire Dust, disposed of all the evidence he could of his presencd by fading away ghe blood, corroding bodies to nothingness, and setting the mech on a timer. He knew Torchprick's goons would be here soon, so he decided to leave a little gift for them inside the suit.
Silme got in the truck, and ordered the mam to move out. They drove slowly at first, but quickly picked up speed as thdy went along their way towards the Loner Zone. They were almost there when a large explosion could be heard rocked throigh the air, causing Silme to smile. I hope they like it, I made it with love, kindness, and a few pounds of highly volatile Fire Dust. I'm like fucking Santa Claus, but with explosions.

TL;DR: Rebellious teen is rebellious, Silme goes against everything that Magdeline says and makes off with a Truck full of dust heading to the Loner Zone. And who says crime doesn't pay? </s>"
408,"<s>[INST] Graham laughed when Magdeline mentioned getting rest. ""Haha, the night is when I'm awake."" He said as a joke. He liked Magdeline, she was very caring, a good quality to have. ""And I'm booked out for most of the week. Well, see ya next week everyone!"" He said with a smile and a wink before putting on his goggles and started to run, he turned back quickly ""Or one of the nights if you're about that!"" He said as more of a kind offer to hang out than promoting himself as a DJ. Graham decided to take the rooftop route as he managed to find an access ladder when he got outside. Graham reached the rooftops a [/INST] nd smiled. He had a good week ahead of him and hopefully a mission at the end. Fun nights and fun fights, his kind of plan. Graham vaulted and slid under pipes and generators, leaping from close rooftop to the next till he reached the residential district. He found his way done and walked home, carefully taking the back alleys and other alternative routes than the streets. His house was a small one but he lived by himself and could do what he wanted. Graham went straight to his room and took off his goggles, chucking them on the bed. He went straight to packing his DJ set, he had a long night tonight. </s>"
409,"<s>[INST] Sapphire had shook her head, smirking at Slime telling her to go home. ""Oh, yeah. I'll see you there."" The cat-girl gives a cute little purr as she waves at Slime when he leaves. Several seconds after he leaves, she says. ""Yeah, I'm gonna follow him."" She gives a smile, pulling up her hood and walking out of the door, making sure that Zanislash was with her. She did not know the kind of trouble that she could get into outside, but knew it could not be good if she didn't have her weapon with her.
Walking outside, she quickly but stealthily followed Slime. Being a cat Faunus helped with this greatly, and she easily stalked him. That was, until he got himself into a fight. Quickly, she scales a roof, and stares down as she watches him fight. Her heart [/INST] thumped and her tail fluttered as she watched him. ""So purrrrfect!"" Sapphire purrs quietly. She had, for a long time, had a major crush on Slime, which didn't seem like it was going to die any time soon.
This was one of the main reasons, as well as the need to make sure her friend would be safe, that the second there was a gap Sapphire leaped from the roof as far as she could, landing perfectly on her feet. She rushes full speed toward the truck, before leaping onto the roof, not making so much as a rustle as she did. Her reddish eyes watch Slime as he defeats all of the men, leaving one alive to drive the truck. She lowers her head, hiding herself, before feeling the truck moves moments later. I wonder where we are going. Sapphire thinks to herself. </s>"
410,"<s>[INST] The truck soon arrived at the edge of the Loner zone, the wall being guarded by androids Torchwick had stolen from Ironwood. They made it easy to smuggle stuff out to the territory, letting you through as long as the driver had correct qualifications. Torchwick might've put some of his men here, but the attacks by Grimm were so frequent, it was just a waste of manpower. Androids also had no emotions that woukd draw the Grimm to the gate, thus making it a less enticing target than the Loner communities spread throughout the interior of the zone, which sprang up and died of like mayflies, here one day and gone the next.
Silme got out of the vehicle, moving to the front to die up the final loose end with a swipe of his claws, adding another layer of shining red to the dull black metal of his Ravagers. He then retracted his claws into the gauntlet section to leave his hands free, knocking out a certain number of taps onto the side of the truck. Soon after, a horde of thugs came out of the woodwork, one man standing out from the rest with his blonde hair, long black trench coat, and the shiny sword he held in his hand.
""Ruthless as always, I see, ever going to tell me how a kid like you is able to so effectively slaughter everything Torchwick sends to protect his shipments.""
""Nope, I like to keep secrets, keeps people on their toes. Now then Carver, I've held up my end of the deal, you hold up yours. Pay up sleazebag."" Silme's clear disrespect of their leader made them rather angry, one more so then the rest.
""Who the fuck do you think you are, talking to Carver like that, ya fuckin' ani-"" Was aa far as he got before Silme rushed over and launched a fist into his throat, cutt [/INST] ing off his words and oxygen. He then went on to break the man's leg by kicking it so hard it bent backwards, then headbutted him in the face with his mask, breaking his nose in a gush of crimson. The man fell over, hardly able to scream fro, both hus throat being punched and the sheer amoint of painmhe was in.
""Anyone else want to talk shit, cause I can bring the claws out if I have to."" All the goon shook their heads, staring at the moaning form of their comrade.
Carver sighed, obviously annoyed by the situation. ""Somebody get this idiot fixed up, and wolf-boy, please don't maim my guys anymore. It draws Grimms, you know that."" He reached into his jacket to pull out several rather large stacks of cash, which Silme quickly relieved him of. Now that the job was done, he had no need to were the mask, so he removed it, taking a big breath of fresh air. His smile quickly became a frown, however, as he smelled someone that was supposed to be at home.
""Sapphire, I said go home, can't you listen to me just one time."" He groaned before jumping up to confront the stowaway on top of the truck.
Carver made a gesture, and his men began offloading the dust from the truck, then he carefully climbed up the front of the truck, standing behind Silme and giving Sapphire a big grin. ""Hey Kitten, how are you doing today, have anything you need to buy cause you know I'm your guy."" Carver was the biggest blackmarket dealer in the Loner Zone and probably all of Vale, if it existed then he could get it for you, using methods you're better off not knowing. He was also a sleazy asshole that had a thing for Faunus girls and a very 'hands-on' approach to flirting that was rarely ever well-recieved. </s>"

She thought that perhaps his aggressive actions were a bit unnecessary, she was almost (as she put it) head over heels for him (though in reality, she was definately head over heels). Her unwavering attention on Slime allowed her to easily see that the wolf had caught her scent when he did.
""Well, you caught me!"" Sapphire says out loud, giving off a giggle, before her face turns red. Carter appeared to be coming over, as well. Sapphire raised herself up, and as if to s [/INST] ay to Carter ""I'm taken"" (even though she wasn't) she wraps her arms around Slime, cuddling up to him with a shy purr. ""H-Hello, Carver,"" she says. The nickname Kitten was kinda nice, she had to admit. It dulled her shyness by the tiniest proportion. ""I'll be sure to c-come to you if I need anything, I guess.""
With that, the cat-Faunus turns to address whom she had her arms wrapped around. ""I just wanted to follow you,"" The girl says, giving a smile and a tiny wink.

412,"<s>[INST] Magdeline
Magdeline was concerned by Silme's methods, but he always reliably got her information, whether he seemed like he wanted to or not. I wish he would seem like he's at least not pissed off to be here. It's hard to work with him sometimes. It feels like he hates everyone here. I'm sure he's been treated bad for being faunus, but I'm not going to treat him badly for anything. The worst I would feel about him would be if he decides to work for Torchwick, which I doubt would happen. Magdeline knew that his hatred for humans was only outmatched by his disposition of Roman Torchwick. The man whose voice was in the White Fangs' ears. Speaking of voices in ears, Torchwick seemed to be talking to someone after all the people left. I didn't see anyone in there, but I may have missed a corner. But he usually talks directly to the person to whom he's speaking...
Magdeline's mind was spinning as she walked home with her falsified credentials to be out this late, posing as a second-shift worker headed home late. She knew a shop owner who would cover for her alibi and had fake records to help the cause. It was win-win. She could walk the streets at night and he could pocket what her ""salary"" would be when he got called in for verification, which was most weeks. The soldiers see a middle-aged woman walking the streets with no weapons (well, none visible) and they don't bat an eye. Usually.
This night, the guards were on high alert. Apparently, a 'wire tap' was on one of the guards at their daily meeting, so they're suspicious of a mole in their ranks. Since they were agitated, they took it out on the citizenry. Tonight, it happened to be Magdeline. ""Hey, lady. What'cha doin' out so late? Gettin' home from yer boyfriend's place?"" Too worn out from avoiding them earlier, Magdeline showed her ""credentials"" and explained she happened to work late. One s [/INST] light mistake: the expiration date on the fake credential has passed. ""Heh. Yer boss ain't keepin' up well with his employees, eh? Or do you even work there?"" His partner chimed decided to chime in. ""Oh my. Looks like we'll have ta book ya. Well, unless there's some... compensation."" Smirking at his oh so clever phrasing, Magdeline just rolled her eyes.
""Look, I'll get it sorted out. You can call him, he's just behind on his distribution of creds, fellas."" ""Well, too bad. It's your responsibility to make sure he keeps up wit' your stuff. Now, you can just pay us, we can take this into the alleyway, or you can try ta run and we book ya."" To which his ever so bright partner chimes in. ""Yeah, and if we book ya, we might still take it into an alleyway. You have been naughty."" Magdeline just rolls her eyes again and, after taking a moment to think, smirks a little herself. ""Alright, boys. If you really wanna, we can take this into the alleyway. Follow me~"" Winking at the end of her sentece, she walks down the alleyway, exaggerating her walk to show off the sway of her ass.
Once she was in a dark enough spot, she pulled out her daggers and hid behind a trash can. Of course the guards come strolling in, trying to act not-aroused and casual, as if they'd seen a possible faunus leaping around in the alleyway. Once they were in range, Magdeline slit one's throat and chained the other, slashing his throat as well. Tossing both bodies into a dumpster, she resumed her transit home from the rooftops and shadowy back ways. Damn. I didn't want to have to kill anyone tonight. I'll have to make sure Thomas updates my creds so I don't have this issue again. I know I'll pay for this later. Probably in the form of my back acting up. Eh, a few glasses of beer and some advil will fix it all up before it even starts. With that, she was finally home and could relax. </s>"
413,"<s>[INST] The alleyway murder of two of Torchwick's goons that night had not gone unnoticed. Hidden eyes watched from the shadows as a middle aged woman slit the throats of two strong healthy men and dumped their corpses in a dumpster as if it was just another day of work. As the woman turned and left the alley a white and red mask, framed by long black hair, emerged from the darkness. The light of a passing car flashed down the alleyway and briefly illuminated the figure's foreign clothes and glinted dully off of the black glass-like sword she clutched in one hand.
Inari approached the dumpster and lifted the lid, giving the bodies a brief glance before looking in the d [/INST] irection the woman had gone. Strange... She thought, letting the lid close once again and releasing her hold on her sword, which shattered into Dust as it left her hand. She turned towards the wall and jumped, traversing up the wall to the rooftop in three leaps. Once there she made her way deeper into the city of Vale until she found a rooftop from which she could see Beacon high above. As she stood there, looking out over Vale and the old Hunter Academy, she thought about what she had seen that night. ""Things are beginning to move in this city..."" She mused out loud, running a finger along the edge of her mask. I must learn more. She finished, in her thoughts. </s>"
414,"<s>[INST] Graham made it to his club venue just before customers were really started to queue up. Graham had this trouble as he had to carry his stuff there as he doesn't have a car. ""Where have you been? The Owner has been waiting for you!"" The bouncer asked.  ""No time to explain just gotta get this set up."" Graham said. The bouncer just shook his head a little, rolling his eyes as he opened the door for Graham. Graham quickly rushed to the stage as everything was set up except for him. He went to the stage and began setting up all of his equipment like the mix desk, laptop, headphones, and microphone to name a few. When he was finished wiring everything he quickly pulled out his phone after putting on the first tr [/INST] ack, a calm one compared to his other tracks he made to start off the night. ""Party at Club Eternity, hit it up if you're looking for a good time!"" He sent to everyone on his contact list, including the Uprisers. The first few people began to come in, ordering drinks and what not.
-3 hours later-
This night was getting good, people were dancing and having a good time, and nothing had went wrong so far. ""Are you all having a good time tonight?"" He asked the audience through his microphone. The crowd responded with cheers, which made Graham smile as he used his sampler and mixing deck to make the song he had to have more bass and turn into a dubstep song rather than an electronic one he was currently playing. </s>"
415,"<s>[INST] As she overlooked the city, Inari would notice a group of Torchwick's goons stepping out of a truckin front of a club, but these weren't members of the White Fang. They all wore deep maroon combat-wear, all of them wearing black Grimm masks that seemed to be resembling that of an Ursa. They were all heavily armed with top of the line equipment, and even from way up high, one could sense the depravity of these men. They were uncaring savages, monsters in the shape of men that wanted nothing more then to wreak bloody chaos whenever they were unleashed. But as intimidating as these men may have been, their leader was terrifying.
He was imossibly tall, around 6'11, with a shock of spiky red hair on his head, and his eyes hidden behind a high tech metal visor, red light emanating eerily from the gaps. He was wearing a similar outfit as his cronies, but his was mostly black, with red lines woven through-out it. His arms wete uncovered, the rippling muscle hidden under a dense layer of coarse black fur, as well as Ivory spikes and plates that ran up the length of the huge limbs. These powerful arms ended in savage claws, sharp as any blade, with one holding a large, brutish weapon, suiting of such a figure. It was a large mechanized black cleaver, bearing one deadly cutting edge, that he swung around with a practiced ease.
Turning towards the club doors, a savage smile on his lips, as he drew back his arm before launching a single punch into the door, blowing it off it's hinges with a loud crash. The people infront of the door went flying back, causing people to stop and turn in fear to look as the men walked inside. Whispers ran around the room, only increasing in intensity when the huge white haired man came in, instantly recognizable by everyone present.
The Butcher
He was Torchwick's main guy, known for being a cruel, heartless man by all, and better still known for bring half-Grimm, though no one knows how that came to be. One thing everyone knew, however, is that where ever The Butcher appeared, people tended to die. He was a man who followed his instincts, and his were always telling him to kill, kill, kill.
The Butcher moved through the crowd, his men standing near the entran [/INST] ce and around the dancefloor with weapons raised, lickung their lips in anticipation. These were the Butcher's Boys, sickos and freaks that got off on violence, death, and mutilation. If anyone were to give them trouble, than the Boys would make them into their toy, were the only thing forbidden to them was to put the toy out of its misery. Once your in their claws, everybody knew you were as good as dead and that it'll be the most painful, agonizing, humiliating death imaginable.
""Hey, old man,"" The Butcher said as he reached the owner of the establishment, lifting him up by the front of his shirt as spoke, ""You're late on your taxes again, asshole, what's the deal. You'd think you'd learn your lessoon after we broke your brother's kneecaps the last time. but obviously not. We gave you a warning this morning, so I'll ask just cause I'm a nice, Do you have it yet.""
The owner was terrified, he had thought he'd have more time. ""I'm sorry, I swear I'll have it by the end of this month, just please spare me."" The Butcher rolled his head, scanning the room from behind his visor until he spotted one girl hiding in the crowd, a pretty young thing bearing a resembalance to the man he held. Smiling, The Butcher proceded to throw the owner into the bar,his smile growing as the girl ran over to him. He grabbed her arm before shr could reach the man's unconscious form and lifted her up, grabbing her roughly by the chin, his claws dangerously close to her face. ""You've been holding out, old man, you're daughter is a real beauty. . . just the kind of girl that Torchwick's been needing to warm his bed at night. Of course, the boys and I will have to give her some training on how to treat the boss, make sure she nice and docile. I look forward to that."" The girl tried her best to struggle out of his grip, but it was no use. He tossed her to two of his boys, who knocked her out by butting her in the back of her head with a rifle, barely able tp control themselves as they undressed her with their eyes, like she was a piece of meat for them to inspect.
With the payment recieved, The Butcher and his men began to make their way out of the establishment, expecting to be unchallenged as was the norm. </s>"
416,"<s>[INST] Graham watched as armed men burst into the club. Clearly Torchwick's, Graham put his goggles on to cover his eyes, trying to play along and keep it cool, carrying on playing his music. Graham observed the apparent leader as he spoke to the owner, this was clearly not boding well. Graham slipped away, taking off his headphones but he kept the music playing. Drawing his tonfas, Graham weaved in-between the crowd, crouching low so he couldn't be spotted. Graham was close e [/INST] nough to keep a clear line of sight on him, right when he was grabbing the girl. Graham twirled his tonfas as he walked behind. He tapped the leader on the shoulder and coughed to make his presence clear. Graham swung his tonfa at the Butchers face when he turned around, grabbing the girl by the wrist in the meantime and threw her into the crowd of onlookers. With the long side of his tonfas facing outwards, he stared down the men, ready to fight with a grin on his face. </s>"
417,"<s>[INST] Magdeline
Magdeline shot up in her bed when she heard an explosion. Couldn't have been a few blocks away at most. Oh, no. That could be someone from the meeting. Deciding against changing out of her fuzzy, greyscale-plaid sweatpants and T-shirt, simply putting her black jacket over it, Maggie grabbed her knife belt and dashed out her rooftop-access attic door and headed to the place with smoke coming off it. I can't see anything. Is that a club...? I remember seeing a text about a party earli- Graham. Something big enough to make that big of an explosion would be far too much for Graham to handle. But I don't know of anything that Roman has that could do this. Other than the tanks, but he keeps those at his house. Well, Beacon. Whatever.
Magdeline got close enough to see that it was indeed the 'Club Eternity' [/INST] Graham mentioned. Magdeline decided to hang off nearby and observe. She'd intervene if things got out of hand. Forgive me, Graham, but we need information. That is one big boy. Wait, is that Roman's Butcher guy? Shit. If he's involved, then someone's really got on Roman's bad side. I don't know enough about how he fights, but I can chain him down for a few seconds if things are about to get bad. We really need information on this guy, but he needs. To. Die. Magdeline sat in a shaded shrub in view of the Butcher, channelling her Aura and readying her sembalance chains for the moment things turn for the worst, feeling helpless and angry beyond compare. The man who killed her son and basically bragged about it to her face was standing right there, and she didn't have the strength or knowledge to kill him. Yet... </s>"
418,"<s>[INST] The Butcher took the punch, letting the girl fall into the crowd. He suddenly found himself not caring about her, no no, not when he had this little morsel in front of him. He rolled his neck, mostly unaffected by his attack. He felt like he was going to really enjoy cutting this little brat into teeny-tiny, bite sized pieces. Maybe he'd find the boy's family and make them watch him do it, maybe he'd have them eat him before he did the same as well. Decisions, decision's, they were all so tempting, but he guessed he could handle that part later. First thing first, time to teach the little shit what happens when you mess with The Butcher and his Boys.
With a gesture of his hand, his boy's took their positions, guarding the exit and making sure that no one would be getting in. . . or out for that manner, as the club's patrons seemed eager to do. They went as far away from the two combatants as the Boy's would let them, the girl being stealthily taken away by the boy's while Graham wasn't paying attention and loaded into the truck. The Butcher did a few test swings with his blade, a warm up if you will, the silence growing ever more tense as he did so, until he finally spoke.
""Kid, you're in way over your head. I've taken on Hunters and Huntresses ten times as tough as you are, and broke them like toothpicks. There was this one lad to, a bright lad just like you, he was a tough fight. . . and he made for a tough meal as well."" The Butcher licked his lips as he got into position, the blade in front of him in both hands, he looked like a bull about to mow down a young calf. And then everything behind him exploded in a flash of darkness, sending him hurtling towards Graham at high speed. Instead of using his blade, however, he simply switched hands in midair, as he spun around like he was going to use it, then launched a powerful jab right a the boy's gut, aiming to send him hurtling into the crowd of terrified patron's. Everyone who had been around The Butcher had been scattered by the blast, literally, as pieces could be seen falling down and blood was splatter everywhere. This caused panic, as people tried to bush past the Boys to get away, only to be ruthlessly gunned down for their efforts. Graham would be caught in the middle of this mad scramble, squeezed like a sardine by the press of bodies against him.
Just as the Butcher had planned, the boy was a fool to challenge him [/INST] in such an enclosed and heavily populated space, and he was now going to face the consequence's of his actions. The ground underneath him exploded again, sending him up into the air, as he spun around with the Cleaver in hand and made a small ball of darkness appear behind him, which flashed red once before it exploded, launching him at where the boy was, caught like a rat in a trap. He was about to cleave him, and everyone who was in the way, into pieces, when black chains came from all around, wrapping around him and holding him in place above the patrons. The Butcher didn't look worried, however, in fact he looked downright pleased. The glow of his visor seemed to intensify, as if their was some beast inside that it was trying to contain, as The Butcher's smile grew wide and hungering, a long, blackened tongue creeping of his mouth to slide along his lips.
""Ohhhhh, so he's one of yours, is he? Your children seem to have a nasty habit of ending up as my lunch, don't they Magdeline."" He poke her name with a sickening fondness, his smile becoming increasing monstrous as the black from his arms seemed to crawl up his neck, ""I told Torchwick that he should've let me have my fun with you back at the Breach, but he said that you wouldn't be a threat, just a dried out old crone who'd know her place. Glad that you didn't, because that means I get to see that beautiful look of despair and loss again and again as I turn another of your brood into nothing but empty sacks of rotten meat."" He began to laugh, a booming baritone of depraved, manic amusement, as his form became enshrouded with a glowing darkness before he seemed to explode, hidden from sight by the darkness.
When it dispersed, only horror would be visible, as a large swathe of people had been cut down, Graham just barely being missed. It had been so close, that he had a small cut on his face. An inch more, and he'd be dead, that was how close it had been. ""Don't think I missed boy,"" The Butcher said, on the other end of the bloody dance floor, covered in blood from the bodies, and proceeding to lick it from his blade. ""I just want Maggy to know that if she doesn't come out soon, she'll be less one more son, that'd but her at -1, a first I'm sure."" Again, The Butcher burst into a fit of manic laughter, the sound of it bouncing off the walls and echoing from all around, like the laugh of a demon, or even the Devil himself. </s>"
419,"<s>[INST] Inari landed outside the club, having been alerted by the chaotic explosions within, just in time to see a pair of savage looking men dragging a girl out towards a truck while two more took position by the doors to allow no one inside. She straighten up and strolled towards the four men, the clack of her clogs on pavement alerting them to her arrival. The two by the door turned towards her as the other two dragged the girl towards the truck. ""Clubs closed, girly."" He said threateningly, brandishing his gun at her as he squinted into the night, trying to make out her details. Inari moved, sweeping her hand towards the men without breaking her stride and the light from the neon club sign reflected briefly off of two objects that flashed through the air towards them. With little more than a gurgled cry the two men at the door dropped, clutching at the black glass knives that protruded from their throats.
The men dragging the girl dropped her and turned to face this new threat only the find her standing right in front of them. The closest made to raise his weapon only to have a long sword blade thrust up through chin. With a cry of rage the last man opened fire, strafing the area with gunfire as Inari moved out of his line of fi [/INST] re. Her blade flashed and the front half of his gun clattered to the ground. She was right there, inches away from his face and the last thing he saw was the dark pits her mask's eyes. Her blade flashed through the air once again and he dropped, like a puppet with it's strings cut.
Inari looked down at the unconscious girl for a moment. A human girl. She shrugged coldly, leaving her there and turning towards the club. It sounded like chaos inside, explosions and gunfire. She readied her blade and stepped inside, only to feel yet another goon as he turned to confront her. It seemed he was the only one to have noticed her entrance as all attention was focused on the large beastial man in the middle of the club. She could practically sense his aura of cruel evil. Grimm. The thought appeared in her mind and, behind her mask, her eyes narrowed in hate. She heard his little monologue and had had enough. With a single leap forwards, she was past the crowd of onlookers and on the dance floor, off to the Butcher's side. She silenced the monster's mad cackling with her own personal self-introduction. The obsidian dagger that she threw glanced off his visor, scarring the headgear and then clattering to the floor, where it disintegrated. </s>"
420,"<s>[INST] Magdeline
The only remaining henchman in her sight, Magdeline tried something she'd never considered doing with her Sembalance before: killing. She focused her chains on the henchman, but specifically on his neck. With rage seething from her in both body language and facial expression, Magdeline squeezed a fist with the hand controlling her Sembalance chains, and it tightened until a *snap* was heard. The chains dissolved with the lifeless body slumping to the ground. By this point, Magdeline was in full view and in the club.
With an eerie calm, Magdeline smiled at Graham, then at this mysterious woman who appeared a little bit ago when she mentions her. ""You should probably head home now, sweetie. And you too, dear. You won't be able to do much of any real damage. I'll take care of him."" Nearly spitting the last word out, though she kept a calm attitude. She turned to the Butcher. ""I don't think we'll need to get animal control involved w [/INST] ith taking out this animal, and it looks like pests are under control, so no exterminator needed. Eh, Grundal?"" Calling the beast by his real name was far from Magdeline's only mental warfare, but she was just trying to attract the big bully's attention so he was less focused on carnage, and less caring about survivors. ""That's right, big boy. I did some research on you before tonight. Turns out, we went to the same academy. Same graduating class. You probably wouldn't remember the group named MNLA (""Magnolia"")? Your team rival all four years? We disbanded a while back. A few months short of a year, actually, due to... complicated circumstances, after the Grimm breached the town. Hard to work with three dead teammates. Oh, and a kid-on-the-way. Yeah, you remember him. I know you do. I hope I can allow you two to be... closer. Like in the same pit."" Her last sentence was filled with undeniable anger, sadness, and pure, unadulterated hatred. </s>"
421,"<s>[INST] Everything went by in a flurry, Graham could barely react to what was going on. Before he knew it, people laid dead and the Butcher stood there, laughing like a maniac. ""You sick bastard!"" Graham yelled. And then suddenly Inari and Magdeline was in the room. Magdeline advis [/INST] ed them both to go home but Graham merely shook his head. ""I'm not going anywhere."" He said, twirling his tonfas. As they twirled they transformed into their pistol form, and Graham aimed one at the Butcher and the other scanning between his men. ""C'mon!"" He yelled to them. </s>"
422,"<s>[INST] The Butcher turned to face the newcomer, turning to look as Magdeline killed one of his boys rather brutally, his monstrous smile never shrinking as he pondered his options. The boy obviously hadn't gotten his message, but that didn't matter now, what matter was that he was outnumbered, 3-1. Which means, he was actually in a fair fight for once.
Raising up his cleaver, it shifted into a cannon-like object which retracted over his forearm before squeezing down to form a snug fit. He then pointed it up towards the ceiling, a darkness raising from the barrel before he shot out a ball of dark Aura into the air, then quickly shifted the cannon from damage to precision, and fired several smaller spheres at each of his opponents, before the large ball exploded with great force, cracking the floor and cloaking everything in darkness temporarily. He switched his weapon back into cleaver form, then blasted himself at the Faunus girl, aiming at her with a swinging over head chop, being much faster with his weapon than any person had a right to be. he'd continue to slash at her in a fast moving barrage, changing it up suddenly in the middle by clicking a button that caused the cleaver to become a scythe, and thus making his attacks much more intense and harder to avoid as he upped the speed, before adding a 5 blast spheres into the misc, blowing them up in her face while they were engaged, then switching targets as the darkness dispersed, this time heading for Graham.
He switched back to his cleaver, but he swung it like a baseball bat at him, intending to smack the kid around a little. Whether it succeeded or not, he's the n launched a bunch, his arm completely blackened with his aura, and he'd unleash a devastating punch right at him, and into the few survivors behind him. If he dodged, they'd take the full brunt of the attack, but if he took the attack, it would do a heck of a lot more than just tickle. The Butcher would then use the force from that attack to launch him into a spinning attack at Magdeline, the darkness finally gone from the room at this point. He'd attempt to slice her in half, the attack being so strong that it would cut deeply into the dance floor, and he actually strug [/INST] gled a tiny bit to pull it out.
'Grundai. . . been awhile since I've been called that. Yeah, I was on team Grendel I believe, the leader and we were sent to the Ivory Grove to face some new kind of Grimm, one that was said to be. . .intelligent. we were the top of our class, and some of the best out there, so us being chosen was a given. Yet it only ended in failure, and when I came back into the world of Man from that hellhole, I was changed, stronger, faster, better than man or faunus!"" Grundai held a hand to his head, the visor was growing really intensely now, and was beginning to pulse in time with his breath. And thhat smile of his was growing inhuman wide now, and the teeth were starting to become very, very sharp. A low, rumbling growl could be heard emanating from deep with in his throat, not in anger, but in pure, unadulterated excitement. The blood on the floor, the fear in the air, the hatred on the faces of those he faced, it did nothing to discourage or weaken him, on the contrary, it made him feel all the more alive. He could feel it, deep inside him, something truly craving this negative energy, the taste of it on his tongue better than fine wine. He wanted, he needed it, he must have.
He would have it. . . but that day was not today. The beast was at the gates, and this wasn't the time to release it from it's cage.
""I made a deal with the devil, Maggy, and it's made me a god amongst men. You were all doomed from the start, and while I'd really like to finish this came, I think it's time I took my leave."" Grundai once again became cloaked in darkness, but it was a much deeper than before, and from it radiated such a sense of hatred, of fear, of pure unadulterated, that it would drive them back, the feeling like worms crawling in their skin. And in one bestial roar, The Butcher released all of the energy he held, the blast effecting the entire club. By the time it cleared, The Butcher and his remaining boys were gone, so was the girl and their truck. The Butcher had escaped. . . or maybe he had let them escape, either way, the end result remained the same. Their were many injured and more dead with in the club, which would probably never become operable ever again. </s>"
423,"<s>[INST] When the monster had struck, Inari had barely avoided the first attack and quickly realised that, with the shrouding darkness in the club, she couldn't rely on just her eyes. Her vision was sharp, but her ears and nose were sharper. When he came at her, the sound of his blade moving through the air and the smell of his sweat were enough for her to keep track of him. Even then he was fast and she was only just able to stay ahead of his swings. She didn't even try to parry or block his attacks, but simply did her best to avoid them.
The last strike he swung her way was the fastest yet and should have been the end of her, but at the last [/INST] second she leapt upwards with all her strength twisting in the air as her semblance took hold and she felt the pull of gravity shift towards the ceiling. She landed, her feet sticking to the roof and the attack passed harmlessly under her. She took a moment to recover and, from her high vantage point, reassess the situation. Then the whole thing was over, before she could continue to act. Another flash of darkness and the monster was gone, along with all of his goons. Inari relaxed her sword arm, releasing the blade from her grip and letting it collapse into dust, as she looked down (up?) at everyone from her position on the ceiling. </s>"
424,"<s>[INST] Graham back stepped as the Butcher swung his cleaver towards him, unfortunately it didn't stop there as his opponent charged up whatever dark energy he was using in his fist. At the same time, Graham used his semblance and took the sound waves emitting from the speakers and launched it forward, making the sound waves slam into the butcher, hopefully slowing down the punch, Graham turned his pistols back into tonfas and double blocked with them, crossing the long sides together. Despite the attempt, the punch was incredible and sent Graham tumbling backwards into the crowd. He was very lucky, that could have been a lot worse. As Graham shakily stood up, the Butcher and his men was nowhere to be seen, neither wa [/INST] s the girl either. Damn it! Why did he have to be so reckless, getting civilians in danger too. Graham collapsed on the ground, tears welling up. ""I'm so... fucking stupid!"" He exclaimed, talking to himself. He punched the ground in frustration. ""Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!"" He yelled at himself again, repeating his actions. He made a promise to himself, he'll train up, become stronger and get back at the Butcher. He stood up and slowly walked to the owner. ""I'm going to get her back. That's a promise."" He said solemnly to the owner. He then turned to Mags and Inari, still keeping his goggles own. ""Thank you, for the help."" He said, and then chuckled. ""Sure kept my ass being destroyed."" He added with a weak smile. </s>"
425,"<s>[INST] Magdeline
The carnage this beast was creating was devastating. To make matters worse, the beast wouldn't let up. It's an unfair fight no matter what. We need to get out of here. There's no way we can take him on like this. At that moment, the Butcher had just slugged Graham and knocked him back. It was her turn now. Seeing the large blade about to be slung at her, Magdeline prepares to dodge, but his speed. He's faster than any man of that size and with that size of weapon should move. She barely dodged, managing to esape with merely a cut along the side of her right abdomen. Clutching it with her left hand, she growls and curses under her breath. Then, with a *poof* and an explosion, the Butcher was gone.
Graham was the first to react, and was beating himself up about not being able to stop the beast-man. Magdeline [/INST] walked over to him, listening to his anger and thanks, and starts rubbing circles on his upper back. ""Hey, it's gonnna be ok sweetie. You did your best. We did our best. That's all anyone can do. He's not a man any more. He wasn't kidding about the deal with the devil. Although, I think it was still metaphorical. Anyways, why don't we go get patched up and get some rest. If you don't feel comfortable staying alone, feel free to stay at my house."" With a smile, she looked from Graham to the young lady on the ceiling. ""Miss, if you need, we can take you to the doctor with us. And if you need a place to stay, you're free to stay with me at my house, dear."" Smiling sincerely at the girl on the inside of the roof, she starts walking out towards her doctor, who would be able to do some work tonight. For a price, obviously. </s>"
426,"<s>[INST] Indigo meandered quietly through the city's night, the dim lighting barely illuminating his path. Not that the poor lighting changed anything: he didn't have anywhere he needed to go to, and people were less likely to see his appearance underneath his cloak. Though he never understood why, people panicked when they saw his Grimm traits. It's probably better that no one knows about me, he mumbled to himself as he continued his slow strides. I'd probably get lonely if everyone started avoiding me... Hmm. A weird thought entered his head. But, like his thoughts on other people, he dismissed it as something unimportant.
Indigo decided to stop and rest on a rickety bench for the night, as he normally did. In the many months that he was in the city, he still didn't really have a home. Nonetheless, thinking about something other than the most efficient way to kill was notably more fulfilling. Not that he saw anything wrong with murdering others, though. Before he could drift off into sleep, however, a loud pounding rhythm started up in a building across the street, a glowing sign above the entry. The words merely confusing symbols to him, he asked the man in the front what was going on. Indigo first received an odd look, then the man responded, ""Can't you tell from the music? It's a party.""
""Music... parties?"" Indigo repeated the unfamiliar words, staring in through a window. He didn't understand what was so interesting about music nor what the purpose of a party was. Neither of them seemed enjoyable, but he was oddly entranced by all of it and continued to stare into the club as the party grew. Eventually, a large truck pulled up to the building, where several of Torchwick's goons and a man with a repulsive aura stepped out. Indigo glan [/INST] ced towards their leader, who, to his surprise, also seemed to be part-Grimm. But instinctually, Indigo could tell that they weren't at all alike; it felt as if that gang would kill purely for pleasure. His suspicious were confirmed by their entrance, which clearly invoked fear in everyone but him.
Indigo walked away, unconcerned by the kidnapping, but a few people suddenly sprung into action. They're probably stronger than the average person, he thought as looked over his shoulder, sizing up the attacks exchanged. Despite this belief, which was fact, he doubted that they could beat that monster of a person before them. That man had much more firepower and resilience than the three, though his speed was nothing to laugh at. Furthermore, the reactions of the others would be slowed by the lack of vision. His conscious was urging him to go help, but he told himself that it wasn't his problem. But shortly after seeing that the truck was heading his direction, he gave in and sighed the words, ""Screw it.""
Indigo ran down the road, where a light was broken and took off his distinctive cloak. He hid well in the darkness without it, and he thought over his plan. The only threat is in the front of the vehicle. The truck was probably loud enough for him to jump on without being noticed by the other half-Grimm. Throw them off before they can make too much noise. If that went well, he'd grab the girl and jump off as well. He had no intention of being caught, so he'd run without her if it were too dangerous. Definitely. Then... murder them as violently as possible. While he couldn't care less if they ran, scum like them shouldn't live any longer than necessary. As soon as the truck passed, Indigo burst out of hiding and leapt onto the tailgate. </s>"

428,"<s>[INST] The Beast Released
Inside the truck, the men strapped in the girl near the front of the truck, looking behind themselves fearfully at the hunched over body that was the Butcher. Every now and then, it would twitch and spasm, causing the men to back away in fear, only to give a sigh of relief as when it calmed down. Grundai was a monster that all around him feared, and even worse was when he lost control of his more monstrous side, which is the reason why he always wore that visor. It injected a type of suppressant directly into his mind, dulling down his insatiable need to kill to as low as it could go. But it couldn't hold it back forever, and when he got excited in a fight, it became even harder for the drugs to take effect. Seeing Magdeline, hearing the rage in her voice, seeing the two new toys she had brought with her, it had gotten to him, made him hungry for their blood. He had very nearly lost himself back their, but it would've been too soon, too easy, to crush them all into a sweet red paste. He wanted his blood to be earned, and when he drank it after a glorious battle, it would taste just like the finest of wines, all of which are perfected with time.
However, it seemed that the universe was not wishing for him to calm down anytime soon. He didn't notice at first, too deep inside his own self-enforced hibernation, but after awhile it became apparent to him. A creature was on the truck, hanging from the back, radiating murderous intent, though it was no were near as potent as his own. Still, the Grimm inside of him [/INST] was drawn to this foul emotion, it called to him, awakened him. He rose, scaring the shit out of his Boys as he turned to them with his trademarked grin.
""Tell Torchwick everything that happened. . . and that I'm taking care of a nasty little bug at the moment.""
And with that, The Butcher turned and lashed out with a clawed hand, easily tearing through the metal of the truck door to grab the head of the stowaway. He tore himself a hole as he stepped out, and then he threw the man onto the empty street, following soon after him, cleaver in hand. Now that he could see the man, he could tell that he was similar to himself, a man gifted with the touch of darkness, buyt he could also see that he was not inline with his instincts. He was trying to be the thing that Grundai had left behind, human. To say that it sickened him was an understatement, as it fueled a sense of hatred in him that couldn't be cooled by merely killing this whelp. He was going to tear him apart, slowly and painfully, going to make him scream his throat out until it's raw and bloody. He would revert this thing back into the animal it was meant to be, into the animal that he himself was.
Without a word of greeting, nor threat, The Butcher charged at the other half-grimm with a blast of energy to propel him, swing at him with the wide blade, then moving to lash out with a unyielding barrage of slashes with his Cleaver, randomly adding in powerful punches and kicks so as to keep his opponent from recognizing a pattern to the movements, and to keep him on his toes. </s>"
429,"<s>[INST] Indigo flinched slightly when a shadowy hand punched through the back of the truck and grabbed his head. At the same time, he felt an abnormally strong killing intent. Well, this is bad, he thought plainly as he was flung off the back, whipping out his Wind Needle in a split second. Twisting his body, he made a slashing motion at the ground with it to give himself the time to land on his feet. Mistaking the location of this guy was a critical error on his part. But Indigo had no time to think about what went wrong, as the man--more a monster--launched himself forward with incredible momentum and a crushing swing.
Indigo leaned backwards to avoid the huge blade, using one hand to punch it up and above his face, the other to create a cushion of air below him. Getting nicked by each strike during the assault, he realized that there wasn't really a pattern in the attacks. However, he laughed out loud when he realized something. It was like music to him: just an annoying, pounding rhythm. Every punch and kick was merely an additional beat between the swings. So it does have a use! he grinned as the dodging becam [/INST] e less and less difficult. Indigo quickly turned to his regular modus operandi: take hits and hit them more. He redirected each swing of the weapon with a nudge while countering with two more clawed slashes, taking fists and feet to the face and gut, but at no point slowing down; rather, the speed of Indigo's attacks eventually increased into a blur from his bloody semblance absorbing every drop that fell from himself and whatever wounds he managed to inflict upon his opponent.
The girl, the truck was suddenly forgotten by Indigo as his mind began to empty. In contrast to his previous, hateful snarl, the instantaneous swap into almost pure tranquility, very slightly tainted by not-so-slight bloodthirst, was much more terrifying. The Butcher had successfully, albeit only temporarily, reverted him into mindlessness. But unlike the past, unlike the half-Grimm in front of him, Indigo had no fury and would have found no joy in shedding blood; it was more like an insatiable wonder for it, amazement mixed with cruel curiosity. ""More..."" he panted aloud, staring at the figure before him. ""I want to see more blood."" </s>"
430,"<s>[INST] Carver had to turn away, pinching his nose to stop the nosebleed that he felt coming on. Too cute, way too cute for wolf-boy, the lucky bastard After he settled himself down, he turned back to the faunus couple with a smile plastered o hus face. ""Just ask and ye shall recieve, I'll even throw in a discount just because of how adorable you are.""
Silme's ears lightly pressed against his head, a sign of slight annoyance and discomfort with the rubbing, a bit of a glare in his violet eyes. However, a ruffling behind him was a sign if his tail wagging though he quickly surpressed the urge as soon as it hit him. One thing he hated about being a wolf faunus, his tail had a habit of giving away what he was thinking. ""Yeah, I guess that's true. You're a good friend Sapphire."" He gave her a scratch behind her ear in the spot she liked, giving Carver a weird look when he offered a discount. Carver never offered discount to anyone.
Sapphire's face turns a little more red, and she purrs even more when she is scratched behind the ear, taking note that the wolf-boy's tail was wagging. ""You're so sweet,"" She giggles. Her heart thumping, she leans up and gives him a single peck on the cheek, wrapping her arms even tighter around Silme. Turning her head to look at Carver, she tilts her head in slight shyness. She had only just met him, so she did not know how often he handed out discounts. She thanks him anyways.
""Thank you for your offer,"" Sapphire says to him, a shy smile on her face. ""I'll be sure to take it up. S-Sometime."" Once again, her head switches back to looking at the handsome man in her arms. She lets out a yawn, pressing her head to his chest. ""Silme, do you wanna sleep in my bed tonight?"" She asks, looking up at his face.
Silme gave her an incredulous look as she called him 'sweet', looking over the side at the guy who had driven him here. ""I think that guy disagree with you on that front, Sapphire, wouldn't you say Carver. . . . Carver?"" Turning his head back to Carver, he saw the man sulking at the corner of the truck, muttering something about how clueless idiots get all the luck. Weird
""As for your offer, I'm fine with it but were are you going to sleep? The couch is comfortable I guess, but wouldn't you prefer sleeping in your own room."" He questioned before he noticed something about his current situation. Sapphire was pressed up very close to him, very close and he could feel her rather sizable chest pressing against his body. His ears immediately flattened themselves against his head, and despite all of his willpower, his tail began to wag furiously, making his already redding face turn a bright scarlet. Some of Carver's men started chuckling at his predicament, only to feel a chill run down their backs as he his head snapped to them, the amount of murderous intent in his Violet eyes sending them scurrying back to work unloading the cargo.
Turning back to Sapphire, the blush on his cheeks still rather prominent, Silme cleared his throat to get her attention. ""Uh, Sapphire, I don't know how to tell you this but, um, they're kinda touching me. . . alot."" He made a vague gesture to her chest as he spoke to clarify things, though it probably didn't need much clarification in the first place. Carver was both reveling in Silme's discomfort, and coursing the fool for not knowing what he had, a sexy cat girl who was begging him for it, literally, and all he could focus on was some intimate contact. It pissed Carver off a great deal it did, so he decided to poke some fun at the boy's embarrassment.
""Oh, come now Wolf-boy, don't act like you're not enjoying this. Your tail's wagging so hard I'm half-expecting it to fall off."" Turning to Sapphire, he placed a hand on his chest and tipped his head to her, leaning on his sword as he did so like a cane. ""I truly feel sorry for you, he's such an oblivious idiot, isn't he, almost to the point where you'd think he's a prude. You have my condolences, Kitten."" Raising his head back up, he fund himself staring into angry violet eyes and down the barrel of Scarlet Ravager. Carver merely pushed the weapon out of the way with his sword, giving Silme a look as if to say, 'Is that really necessary?'
""Kitten, you'd should probably keep your boy here on a collar, lest he rips someones throat for giving him a bad look. Why so sensitive, Silme, trying to over-compensate for something?"" Carver grin grew very wide as he saw the boy's confusion as he tried to work out the hidden meaning of his sentence. It's just to easy to mess with this idiot, really, it's not a fair fight in the slightest.
""Well, I'll be sleeping... With you. In the same bed."" Sapphire giggles, watching as his face turns scarlet. Awwww, that's so cute! The cat-girl thinks to herself, starting to purr, before her own face turns red because of his comment about her breasts touching him. It was a little embarrassing, but she didn't care as long as it was Silme that was with her. Sapphire turns and looks at Carver as he begins to speak.
After Carver finishes speaking, Sapphire turns back to Silme. She leans up, standing on her tiptoes, and gives Silme a kiss on the nose. Completely ignoring what Carver said (so she would not try to attack him for making fun of Silme), her face turns red. We've been friends for such a long time. If he's not going to ask it... I will. Sapphire closes her eyes, returning to standing flat on her feet. ""S-Silme..."" She says, her voice suddenly quiet. ""D-Do you think... T-That there is any c-chance of us... Dating?"" She asks shyly.
""Huh?"" was Silme's eloquent reply, unsure if he had heard her right. ""Wait, you mean, like, a Date-date, like, with hanging out, and holding hands and k-k-k-k-kissing?!?!?"" Silme was a man of many skills, but they were all violent or criminal in nature, he was not good with dealing with his emotions, so he honestly didn't know how to feel about Sapphire's request. On one hand, he could openly say he didn't hate her(which for him, was almost as good as a declaration of love), but on the other. . . he was afraid. He hadn't ever let anyone in like he felt like Sapphire was asking him to let her in, not since his parent's had left him. Would she do the same, once he let her in, would she leave him all alone, out in the cold, alone again in the world with his heart ripped out and stomped.
He couldn't deal with this, he wouldn't deal with this. It was just, just too much, too soon. His heart was pounding, his pupils dialated, his ears back and tail between his legs, he disengaged himself from Sapphire, looking like a cornered wolf. Just as he was about to say something, however, a ominous howl tore through the night, and it was soon followed by many, many more, along with the clacking of claws against concrete, and the growls of hungry beast coming towards a meal. A pack of Beowolves burst from the darkness, descending on the group with a savage ferocity that only Grimm could possess.
Immediately, Silme's mind was cleared of all his worries, his woes, all of his senses turned towards fighting these monsters. He acivated Scarlet Ravager, shifting them into short sword mode as he ran forward jumping off the truck into the midst of the pack in a swirl of blades, an explosion soon following as he mixed Fire and Wind Dust together in the air, giving him some space and spreading the corrosive air across the pack, blinding them for a few moments at best. Carver's men began to fire on the Grimm that got to close to the shipment, but they were in no hurry to help Silme, as was the Loner way. It was every man for himself in the Loner zone, and you only looked out for others if they were your own.
Carver leaped down from the truck on to the ground, swinging his sword around as he called out to Silme. ""I fucking told you that killing the guy would attract Grimm, Wolf-Boy, so please do the dirty work while me and my boy's get this cargo to safety. Thank you."" As Carver was speaking, a Beowolf came up from behind him, about to strike him down, when he suddenly turned around and stabbed the beast in it's chest with his blade, before pressing a button that caused the blade to become heavily serrated. ""I fucking hate it when dogs like you don't know your place. GET SHREDDED, YOU FUCKING FLEABAG!!!"" Pressing a second button, the serrations on the blade began to spin around rapidly, turning the sword into a type of chainsaw as it tore the beast insides to piece, before he slashed upward with it, effectively bifurcating the Beowolf. Carver clicked his tongue before walking away from the Grimm's dissolving Carcass toward his men, yelling them to pick up the pace before he turned them into Grimm chow himself.
Silme, on the other hand, was in a litte bit of trouble. As he was slashing through the Grimm, his focus wasn't a 100% because he was still thinking about Sapphire's question, what it meant, what he should do about it. This caused him not to notice as the Bewolves surrounded him until it was too late, and then he was stuck trying to hold them off while he attempted. Every time he tried, a Grim would charge at him from all sides, looking for an opening,and getting a sword in their throat instead, but they still mangaed to keep him effectively trapped, and he was beginning to tire. He was used to using his aura, but he had been expecting to have another intense fight today, so he had used more of it in his first attack against the mech and when he fired at those goons as they exited the store, wanting to make sure the job got done.
Now he was paying the price, panting heavily as he fended off a seemingly never ending wave of Grimm, barely able to keep them back. The only reason he was able to keep them all from charging him at once was because he had surrounded an area with a corrosion field using special Dust cartridges he had on him just in case. It was very painful to go through, though essentially harmless, and helped stem the flow of Beowolves coming at him. But it would only last so long, and even if it did last a while, the Grimm were beginning to attack in higher and high numbers as they figured out that it wasn't going to kill them upon entering. Suddenly, Silme got bull rushed from the side by one of the Beowolves, and ad to use more Aura to keep it from tearing his arm of, which it had firmly in its grasp.
This is it he thought with grim finality, feeling himself get weaker and weaker as the struggle continued. I'll die the same way I cam into the world. . . alone
Sapphire felt a little bit like she was going to sob. ""Y-Yes... T-That stuff..."" She whispers, looking at Silme with an embarrassed look. Shouldn't have asked, shouldn't have asked, she thinks to herself sadly, her face entirely red. Like starving men fighting for food, her mind fought for what to do. Fragments fought for pushing in, deeper, and making Silme date her, others fought to begin convincing him he should, an [/INST] d a few fragments fought to drop everything she had said, and pretend like she never said a thing.
Her lips tremble as Silme parts from her, and tears well up in her eyes as he backs away. H-He... I... I didn't expect this to... Feel so bad. Sapphire opens her mouth, and sucks in half of a breath -which sounds like a sad wheeze- and opens her mouth to speak, however is interrupted by a howl so loud it makes her squeal. Grimm! She thinks, whipping out Zanishlash and turning it into it's separate shield and sword forms-
Just in time, as a Beowolf leapt onto her, the shield protecting her from it's swipes.
Sapphire twists around, knocking it onto the ground and rolling out of the way to avoid a swipe from a second one. Rolling to her feet, she manages to clip the throat of the second Beowolf on the way, and spies a third behind her. As the first one gets onto it's feet, she drops her sword, twisting her hand around so that the bottom of the hilt was facing where the blade was meant to be, the blade it'self going along her arm now, so she was holding it backwards. Sapphire did this with great precision and skill, so she was ready when the first Beowolf attempts a swipe. She fires, and the cat-girl uses the blast from the gun to push her arm backwards, straight into the stomach of the third Beowolf that attempted to make sure she wouldn't get home.
Suddenly, the battle picked up. Aura helped a lot with avoiding the attacks of two Beowolves that had leapt onto her, looking like some pervert's twist of a girl and Grimm. She kicked her knee up, catching one in the crotch, but she fought with tooth and nail to keep their claws from hitting her head, as she had her shield protecting her chest. Her eyes darted around, looking for a way to escape. Through the blurs of stressful tears in her eyes, she spotted Silme fighting for his life. The sight killed her. Sapphire had just asked him if they wanted to date, she had asked him the question of all questions, and there he was. Fighting. She bursts out with tears at the sight, pushing hard against the Beowolves on top of her.
Pushing her shield up, hard, she shoved the Beowolves high before Sapphire turns, her eyes a dark red shade, as if she had just came for a cup of tea and a souvenir to bring back to hell with her. As the Beowolves fall back down behind her, she connects her sword and shield together, forming the strength-draining power that was her weapon's final form. She cries out loudly, charging straight to the Beowolves attacking Silme, causing a few of them to turn. She fires, taking one out immediately, before she slams into another, firing as she does. As she shreds the wolf, another attempts to pounce on her from behind. Sapphire turns, whacking it out of the air with her shield as if she was whipping a fly away. Now that she had a good shot, she fired at the Beowolf clinging to Silme.
The beast had let go of Silme to growl at Sapphire, only to get it's head blown off instead. Silme was quick to get back on his feat and was now back-to-back with Sapphire. There were just too many, ad even with Sapphire's Tearfuel, she couldn't hold them back forever. Switching Scarlet Ravager to SMG mode, he prepared himself what was likely going to be their end, when a golden flash appeared before them, revealing Carver standing there with a smile on his face.
""Well, lookie here, Wolf-boy, you seem to be in a spot of trouble, so let me help you out, okay. Consider this a favor, one that I expect you to payback in the future."" Carver said, his smile turning from charming to devious within seconds, before he turned to face the Grimm that had appeared, tut-tutting at them while he wagged his finger. ""Naughty, naughty beasties you all are, attacking my wolf boy like that, haven't you read the villain's hand book, you're supposed to be attacking one at a time, like the proper cannon fodder you filthy excuse for monster you mutts are.""
Carver, what are you doing, their are too many."" Silme began, only to find himself get pelted in the head by a pebble. The thing was, it had fucking hurt, and he reached up to feel the spot on his head, he found that it came away bloody. How had he done that?!?!
""Wolf-boy, didn't you know what I used to be before the breach happened, the man was,"" Carver stated, as a horde of Beowolves stormed through the Aura dorm towards him tied off waiting for their food to shut up. ""I was a damn good hunter, so please don't patronize me."" As the first Beowolf reached him, it suddenly found it's self split into, as did the one behind it, falling to Carver's side as he turned to face the monster's that surrounded him, his jacket beginning to take an intense glow, 3 colors of red, white and green.
In another flash of gold, he was in the thick of it, spinning his blade in a compete circle faster than one could blink, soon followed by the spray of blood as the Grimm's faded away, falling to the ground in a smoking hip. from their on, it was a massacre, completely one-sided as Carver tore through Grimm after Grim, again and again. either flashing from one place to another, or moving his blade at a nearly untraceable speed. For times when the blade wasn't enough, however, he'd use the dust in his clothes to launch either a devastating blade or gust of wind at the beast, or completely incinerate them in columns of intense white flame. He was like a god of war, and soon, the few Grimm left alive fled for the hills,fleeing back into the interior. Carver turned backed to the two with a smirk, knowing that they were probably dumbstruck by mind-numbingly cool he was. I'm a fucking boss, and now they fucking know it, so they better respect me or else I'll be kicking some serious ass!
""And that, Silme, is why I never flinched once when ever you pointed any kind of weapon at me, because my Sembalance is Instant Acceleration,"" Carver explained, enjoying the way he saw the boy flinch when he actually used his real name,""allowing me for a single instant, wither increase the speed of my blade swings, and thus their power, or move near instanteously from one point to the next. So basically, as you are now, you'd be no match for me. So then, you'll be coming with me and my boys now, I assume, not safe for you and Kitten to wonder the upper levels. I doubt that was the whole pack, and neither of you are in any shape tto face off against any Grimm on your way back."" Pointing with his blood-stained blade, he showed them the entrance/exit he and his men were using to transport the goods. ""Come on now, don't be shy. . . and also be quick about it, we don't have all night.""
Watching what Carver did, Sapphire was awestruck by his pure power. However, she also took him as a bit of a bragger because of his power. As he killed most of the Grimm, she still took out her aggression on those that were near her. She took heavy breaths, and obliterated those near her. A final Beowolf managed to climb onto her, however a strong punch to the side of it's head threw it off of her before she activated the blade of her weapon and drug it straight into the stomach, doing a pirouette and cutting all the way up to the creatures neck. She pulled Zanislash out and looked around as the final of the Grimm retreated.
Wiping stray tears away from her eyes, tears of struggle and sadness, Sapphire looks to Silme as she turns her weapons back to their small, portable form. He's alright... He's alright... The cat-girl, recovering from what had just happened, looks to Carver as he picks on Silme again. She tried to say something, but now that she no longer had Tearfuel, she felt tired, so very tired. She stumbles her way over, attempting to follow Carver and his men to where they were moving to, when she just tilted and fell over sideways. Now that her Tearfuel was over, it's additional strength had perished with her, and her normal strength had been used in the fight, combined with the drain of Zanislash's combined form, she had stressed herself way too far and was weak. Sapphire's eyelids drooped halfway closed, and she whispered the word, ""Help,"" laying down on the ground.
Silme, who had been walking with Sapphire towards the tunnel, went to catch her before she completely hit the ground. He then decided to carry her on his back, coaxing her on before he followed Carver and his men down the tunnels. Carver was walking next to him, looking at Silme with an expectant gleam in his eye.
""I'm not saying thanks, because I know you didn't do that out of the kindness of your heart, Carver, you want something."" Silme glared at the older man, but it quickly turned into a look of suspicion and confusion as he thought back to Carver's earlier words. ""Tell me, Carver, if you were such a good Hunter, then why didn't you try and put an end to Torchwick, or at least try and fight him like the others did?""
""Simple kid, I wanted to live more than I ever wanted to protect the people. Being a hunter wasn't working out for me as well as I thought around the time the breach happened, so when the Grimm began to overrun the city, I took the opprotunity to have myself a little accident, then I changed my name and badda-bing, badda-boom, Carver's in business by creating safe travel routes for anyone who wants to start a smuggling business. Then I took over the business and have become a very wealthy man.""
""You're a smart guy, but what happened to your team?""
""I don't know, and for the sake of my conscious, I'd like to believe they all are alive and kept their heads low.""
Silme nodded, before he began to recognize the tunnels they were in. He gave Carver a nod, then went down a branching tunnel which would lead to Faunus Plaza, a makeshift underground settlement that is populated mostly by Faunus, though it was more of a patrol station and outpost than anything else. While these Tunnels were great at keeping people safe, Grimm still came in, and Faunus were elected to be the best watchmen due to most having excellent night vision. He navigated through the empty streets until he made it to Sapphire's home, usin his key to open the door.
Walking upstairs, he laid her down on her bed, where she curled up unconsciously, since she had fallen asleep along the way. For a second, Silme remembered her offer, but he shook his head of it and walked out of the room. He did't want to give her false hope that he would reciprocate her feelings, he didn't even now if he wouldn't. He needed time to think about this, but it would have to wait until tomorrow, he was much too tired to deal with that tonight. So he walked down the stairs, into the living room and crashed onto the couch, letting the sweet release of sleep wash over him like a river.

TL;DR: Silme and Sapphire now have awkward romantic tension, due to Sapphire kinda confessing(she asked for a date) and Silme not responding. Grim attack happened, Carver revealed himself to be a hunter of great skill </s>"

The men finally returned with the truck in the airlift. Roman noticed a... sizeable hole in the back. ""Um... What is that?"" Pointing at the hole, Roman asks the van's driver. ""Sir. The Butcher did so after saying to tell you what happened and that he was going to take care of a bug."" After a few seconds of silence, the dictator facepalmed and finally asks: ""Well, what happened!?"" ""Oh, right! We were ambushed at the club. The DJ, Magdeline, and some masked bitch came in and interrupted the extraction, sir. Several men died, but we got the girl."" ""... You mean her?"" Roman asked, pointing the hook of his cane at a tied up female hopping away. ""Yes sir. Her. ... OH! I'll get her, sir!"" The soldier took a while to realize his mistake, but Roman lifted his hand to stop him. ""I can do that. Thanks for the offer, though. Dolt."" With that, he launched the hook at the escapee, catching her by the rope that bound her hands. Roman then dragged her back, apologizing to the miss that he was so rough. Helping her up and undoing her leg bindings, Roman explained how she wouldn't be leaving until her father paid his taxes plus the debt he owes. ""Well, at the earliest. There may be a 5-7 business day shipping time, but we'll make sure you aren't harmed. Needlessly."" Now guiding the young lady by the small of her back, Roman explains her position. ""I now own you. You are now collateral for the money your father owes. Until the debt is paid, you get to stay here with me. We'll have fun."" L [/INST] ooking her over, he repeats ""Lots of fun. Heh.""
Magdeline
Magdline takes the company she has with her back to her place, taking back roads and underground tunnels. Once home, she opens the door, takes a few steps in, turns and welcomes her company. ""Well, home sweet home. The couch in the living room has a pull out bed, I have a... um... guest room."" Calling her son's old room a guest room was hard. It was the first time she'd thought about the room in a long time. Refocusing on getting her company settled in, she continued, a little less enthused. ""Um... You can sleep wherever you'd like. Feel free to get some food or drinks. The kitchen is right through the archway in the living room there."" Magdeline points through the living room to the kitchen. ""If you need clothes, I have some, both for guys and girls. Whichever you prefer..."" After a deep breath, she continued. ""So yeah, make yourself at home. I'm gonna head to bed though. I'm tired from all the fighting... And thanks for sticking with me, even when I asked to fight him alone. I probably couldn't have done much but buy a few dozen seconds. I really appreciate your help."" With a bow of respect. ""If you'll excuse me, I'm going to head on to bed."" With that, Magdeline heads up the stairs, unzipping her jacket once at the top and, once in her room, removing the jacket. Now that she was in her PJs as before: tank top and fuzzy pants, neither of which she'd taken off or changed out of when she'd left the house, she slid back into bed. </s>"

The Bucther hadn't suffered much from the boy's attacks, a few scratches of vary severity, but nothing that would be a hinderance to him. He lifted his blade to, which he shifted into it's hand-cannon form aiming it at one of the nesrby houses, where people were looking outside to see what was going on.
A pull of the trigger, a streak of black, a cry in the night, then a split-second of desthly silence followed immediately by a loud boom as part of the house exploded, the corner, wh [/INST] ich brought the rest of the house down as well. The Butcher walked over to the mangled mess, sniffing the air before he found whag he was looking for. Reaching into the rubble he pulled out a man that was barely clinging to life, with several stakes in his body, taking a second to make sure he was conscious before tossing him at the feet other half-grimm.

Magdeline woke up in a haze. Last night's events had started to eat her away in her dreams. It just kept replaying. The carnage. The brutality. The screaming. The blood... Finally shaking herself mentally once she was in the kitchen, she noticed Graham who was probably about to leave, asking to help him train. ""Well, I can try, sweetie. I don't know how to fight with your weapon, but I can help you read opponents better and help you learn Grundai better, if you're really worried about him. He's gonna be tough. He's gotten a lot better at blocking out psychological warfare than I remember, but he's gotta have a weakness..."" After staring off into space for a few seconds, she turned to the fridge t [/INST] o grab some eggs and bacon she'd bought the other day.
Magdeline placed her hand on Graham's head and smiled at him. ""Don't worry so much about last night. I know we can get his daughter back. And not with a fundraiser. Now, would you like some food? And if you want to start training today, I can help you after work. Which I'll have to leave for in about half an hour. You're welcome to stay here if you like. The spare key's under the brick with the 'X' on it under the back door mat if you need to go out and come back. Just remember that you're already a great fighter. You just need to know how to fight this enemy. Alright?"" And with that, Magdeline returned to her ingredients to start cooking up some food. </s>"
437,"<s>[INST] Melanie
The young girl held ransom lay in the fetal position on the ratty old bed she was put in. It had been one day, and the club owner's daughter had been dragged through hell. She was unable to do much more than cry and remember all the shit that had hit the fan in the past few hours. She was a virgin before tonight...

After being kidnapped from the club, Melanie had been brought to Torchwick's palace and told she is now just a... a possession of Torchwick's. The guards had barely taken her into the room they called hers, 231, before nobody in the room had clothes on. Torchwick had put a special chastity belt on Melanie, to prevent unwarranted... 'use of his property'. But it only covered her frontal opening, and the guards who brought her in, and a few White Fang guards, and a few other guys who happened to wander by, all took every inch they could get out of her. After almost two hours of repeated... 'use', Torchwick finally arrived. Maybe he planned for it to be the way it was, but he was nicer than his guards. Yeah, he still pulled her hair a bit, forced her head movement during... 'oral presentations', and was rough from the moment he was aroused, but it wasn't as bad as the men before him. Maybe Melanie had just become numb to it, after dozens of men before Torchwick in the past hour or two.

After this last memory round and a few minutes of crying, Melanie finally fell asleep. She didn't know why. Maybe it was just out of pure exhaustion. Melanie had horrible dreams, but slept soundly well into the day. The sun hitting her face finally woke her up. She looked around the r [/INST] oom. She saw a dresser, and in it were a few outfits. Maid's outfit, ""nurse's"" outfit, and a nice sun dress. It looked pretty. She decided to at least be hopeful that things wouldn't get worse than they were and put on the sun dress. Only to notice how opaque it was. You could almost see completely through it. With a little ingenuity, Melanie put together an outfit that used items from each of the provided ones that was as modest as possible and looked cute. Well, I can at least look decent.
Deciding to face her fear head on, Melanie walked out of the room to the entry room Torchwick had a throne in. She met no guards on the way. The throne room had a few guards. A few she knew a little too personally. Deciding to throw everyone off, Melanie smiled and greeted Torchwick cheerfully. Torchwick looked confused to see her, and more so that she seems happy. ""Hello there, Mr. Torchwick. Is there anything I can do for you? I couldn't find too decent of a dress, so I kinda improvised. I hope you like it."" Melanie winked at Torchwick and bowed once she finished. Torchwick and his guards were speechless. The ruling dictator finally reigned in his mind and responded. ""Oh, wow. I wasn't expecting this. I usually leave some sexy dresses for the... 'collateral' I have. Your positive attitude and willingness to serve are refreshing. If you would make some food for the two of us, that would be splendid. I'll be back shortly to dine with you. Can't wait to see you."" Torchwick called Melanie's playful bluff. With no cards left to pull out of her sleeves, Melanie nodded and made her way to the kitchen. </s>"

He really appreciated this from Magdeline, she didn't have to help him but he's glad she agreed. He had to get her back. He felt... responsible, for what happened, and it's the least he could do. Graham was about to exit when Mags mentioned the key [/INST] . ""Then I guess you won't mind if I let myself in."" He said jokingly. ""Thanks again Mags."" He said again, hoping to show his gratitude. With that, Graham left the house. He searched for a way to the roof, and after doing that he looked out across Vale. ""Time for a new look."" He said to himself before setting of to his house to grab his wallet. </s>"

It was a full moon. Which meant all of them were coming together at the Cabin. First dinner, then Grimbold would have a job to give to them.

Robert Taylor

Location; Grimbold's Cabin
Interacting With; Grimbold and whoever is sitting next to him.
It was only february, and it would still take a month before the sun would rise above the mountain again. The frozen leaves rustled under Robert's boots as he walked through to forest on his way to Grimbold's Cabin. He knew some of the others had to tell their parents stories of where they were going. Maybe they would say they were helping this old man who could use an extra hand. How noble. Or maybe they told them they went to their theatreclub practice. But not him. Robert lived alone and just needed to make sure nobody saw him when he went out, or where he was heading. It was simple enough, but a necessary thing to pay attention to. He thought of the time that he had had no other choice than to transform into his fox form to be stealthy enought to get past some people without being noticed. Ofcourse he had to leave his clothes behind. So the entire evening he had been wrapped up in one of Grimbold's blankets to cover him and to keep warm. They had made fun of him. But it happened to others from time to time as well.
Grimbold opened the door slightly and peered through the opening with one eye, as he always did.

“Ah, Robert my boy! [/INST] Come in!” The man said with a heavy voice that wouldn't look strange on a seasond sailor. He patted him on the back only slightly too rough to be comfortable. “Almost everybody is here already. Just a few more. Come! Give me your jacket and take a seat. I made soup!” The man practically took Robert's jacket of him before he was even prepared for that. He just let it all happen. It was meant as a nice gesture.
Robert went into the cabin where he found the familiar comfortable, cozy and sort of romantic cabin atmosphere. It smelled of forest and smoke and vegetable soup. It was the wood, the fire place, the hand-crafted furniture, that all made it seem so welcoming. And there were the animal skulls on the wall, and the old fashioned candles everywhere, that gave of something slightly sinister. But it was a perfect place for them. It seemed to match Grimbold's personality as well. Warm, comforting, mysterious and slightly off. Entering the room, Robert saw about half of the crew already at the table. Chatting, eating the soup Grimbold made, telling jokes, arguing. The way things usually went on these gatherings.
“Hey guys!” He said while looking around for Eddie. Sitting down, he sighed. It had been a long day at the library. And the night had yet to begin. “Pour me some soup, will ya” He said to the person next to him, as he stretched out his arm with his bowl in his hand, towards the large stockpot. “So, how was your day?” </s>"

Grimbold liked to have them all meet up at his cabin. Most people should probably be wary of an old man who invited a bunch of young adults to his cabin all the way in the woods far away from the eyes of society but then again, most people don't have the ability to transform into little woodland creatures. They weren't exactly normal people. Grimbold was nice enough to serve them food each time they made the trip up there though. Today he was serving some sort of vegetable soup.
Unfortunately, Terry was not very hungry. She doesn't make it a habit to eat at Grimbold's cabin and always made sure she ate beforehand. So she sat quietly at the edge of the table while everyone else was chattering about their day or what not. She was simply waiting for Grimbold [/INST] to begin the meeting so she could figure out what she needed to do and go home. But they could not start because not everyone was there yet. ""People should learn to come on time,"" she thought to herself as she made another count of who was here.
Just then, Robert had arrived and had taken the seat next to her. ""Of all people..."" He was the only person that didn't seem to get when she didn't feel like talking, which was most of the time.
She stared at him, then his bowl, then back at him. ""What am I? Your server?"" she muttered quietly before grabbing the ladle. Despite her annoyance, she did get the boy some soup. It wasn't out of her way and she didn't want him reaching over her to serve himself anyways.
""You should really learn some manners,"" she added coldly after his bowl was filled. ""And get a haircut while you're at it."" </s>"

Eddie smiled at Robert as he took the seat between him and Terry.
""Hey man, how was the library?"" Eddie asked while Robert got his soup.
Eddie actually really liked coming to the cabin. Normally a large open fire would put him on edge, but here it made him comfortable. Far away from everything else, with his friends, with Grimbold. He could even tolerate the people who are usually really pushy [/INST] .
Eddie picked his bowl back up and ate, while listening to the idle chatter of the room. Wonder what old Grimbold has in store for us tonight? News? A new mission? Eddie thought, excited at the prospect of getting a new mission, and discussing plans with Robert. Hopefully the rest didn't run into any trouble and would get here soon.
Eddie's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of knocking, and then the standard Grimbold greeting. He turns around to see who it is. </s>"

The tattoo artist had been out of town for the last week, and even worried she wouldn't be back on time for Grimbold's dinner. So, after returning to her own apartment, unpacking, feeding the cat, and freshening up, she rushed over. Bundled up against the cold February air, she finally arrived and knocked at the cabin door. Ever paranoid, Grimbold peered at her before opening the door with a welcoming smile--one that she returned. ""Thank you, I got it,"" she assured as she walked in, taking care of her coat and scarf and hat and gloves... Sloane liked the silence of the cold winter air, but she was admittedly a freezebaby.
Warmth comforted her as she stepped further into the cabin. The fire crackled and she inhaled the aroma of a good homecooked meal. A rare, genuine smile came to t [/INST] he woman's face as she unwound the knitted scarf from her neck. Even the creepy skulls and the air of mystery was enjoyable to Sloane, though everyone here was a little weird in their own way. She certainly wasn't the only one. Her grin faded and she looked bored again as she shoved her gloves in her coat pocket.
After putting her outter layers away, the click of her heels announced her arrival as she stepped into the dining area, green eyes taking the lot in as they got comfortable. Despite being late, Sloane wasn't one to apologize. ""Hello, lovelies,"" she greeted as she stalked over to the seat across from Terry and Robert. She offered a friendly nod to Terry before she stretched her colorful arm across the table to fill a bowl with soup. She seemed to ignore Eddie as she sat back, shoulders straight, legs crossed, arms crossed, and her hungry eyes on the soup in front of her. </s>"

'Of all the things to forget...' Cara sighed, shutting her apartment's front door behind her with a slam. She threw her bag off to the side, quickly checking her watch. She knew she was late, very late. Gandalf - I mean Grimbold - would probably not appreciate her tardiness, especially on the full moon.
Cara slid off her wedges, instead moving to her bedroom to change into something a lot more comfortable in order to meet the other critter-family at Grimbold's cabin for dinner. After fifteen minutes, Cara was dressed appropriately and feeling fresh, the stress from the morning medical [/INST] lecture slowly draining as Cara returned to the front hallway, her hands in her hair trying to tie it into a bun.
Her apartment wasn't too far off from the forest, so Cara decided to hike it up to Grimbold's cabin instead. It took another twenty minutes, but she was finally there and knocking at the front door.
The door seemed to have opened almost immediately, as if Grimbold had been standing there the entire time. Cara gave him a charming smile, ""Lectures, sorry."" She vaguely explained, before slipping past the elderly man and towards the gathered group of misfits.
She took the seat beside Sloane, grabbing herself a serving of soup before sitting down. ""So, did I miss anything important?"" </s>"

""I can't stop this feelin'.... deep inside of me.... girl you just don't realize.... what you do to me...""
Singing along - not too quietly - to her music, Angel grabbed her jacket from her chair, glancing in the mirror before leaving her bedroom. Not that this was necessarily first impressions, she still felt as thought people weren't too sure on how to judge her. Which meant impressions were still being made - ergo, her outfit was slightly more thought out this night. She was definitely feeling the rocker vibe tonight, despite the very jazzy and upbeat tunes of Blue Swede, and had dressed accordingly. Black leather jacket, ripped jeans, her favourite AC/DC vest, black boots, and dark make-up, she seemed good to go.
Walking downstairs, her boots made satisfying thuds on the hardwood flooring. She's probably nicked the floors more than once with her variety of heels, but Uncle James didn't particularly care. He didn't care about a lot of things - just as long as she and her brother didn't get involved with illegal activities or... y'know, died. Now, she knew for sure that her graffitiing and drinking [/INST] of alcohol was breaking the law - but she was yet to come into contact with the police over it.
As for where she was going tonight, well... she doubted there were even laws that existed in the modern world regarding the strange little family she had recently found herself a part of.
Glancing at her watch, Angel stifled a sigh as she reached her front door - perfect. Late. Hopefully taking the dog for walkies was a good enough excuse for the old coot.

Despite her heels, it didn't take Angel all that long to make her way to the cabin - upon arrival, she was slightly out of breath, headphones dangling around her neck as she knocked on the door. Joan Jett could still be heard blaring from either speaker as she entered, offering up an apologetic smile to Grimbold for her lateness.
""I'll keep the jacket on, I think. I didn't really consider the cold when I was dressing myself earlier."" She said with an easy smile towards the Mentor, and then taking her place at the table, beside Cara.
""Howdy all. Hope you didn't do anything fun without me."" Grabbing a bowl of the soup as she talked, Angel was more than pleased that she had skipped dinner tonight. Homemade soup definitely trumped microwave chips. </s>"

It was tiring really. Tobias had been working double shifts at his job, and now Grimbold wanted everyone to meet on one of the coldest days all year. Not exactly the break Tobias would get if he simply went home and slept the night away, but Grimbold was always persistent about these meetings, and he'd rather not have Grimbold show up at his apartment asking why he wasn't there.
After a short trek to the lonely cabin in the woods, Tobias meant to knock, but Grimbold was already there, opening the door for him. Creepy guy indeed. ""Had to stay at work a bit to close, so I'm a bit late, I know."" Entering the cabin, he could already tell everyone wasn't here yet. Robert [/INST] , Eddie, Terry, Cara were already here. And Sloane, but Tobias would rather pretend she wasn't. His nerves would appreciate it if he didn't interact at all with her tonight. Work had already tested his patience, Tobias didn't need her to do so as well.
Tobias decided to stand next to Angel, hoping she and Cara would act as a buffer between him and Sloane. Also, it would ensure he wouldn't even have to look at Sloane at all tonight, as long as he didn't look to the side. The soup looked appetizing enough, but Tobias had eaten at work already, so he didn't take any of it for himself. Not to mention it would be a hassle to eat standing.
""Hey."" Wasn't much of a greeting, but Tobias wasn't particularly close to anyone, so he felt it was adequate. </s>"

When people started arriving at the old man's cabin the feline moved into the shadows apparently going unnoticed as her intent.
Eddie and Teryn were the first to arrive. The slender black cat quietly watched as they sat at the table and ate Grimbold's vegetable soup. Lumpy four-eyed Eddie with his dirty sneakers and Teryn with her modelesque figure and shimmering black hair sat at the table with an empty chair between them. Eddie was the classic stereotypical nerd. He seemed to be a good guy with a good heart but never stood up for himself and thus made himself an easy target for those with more abrasive personalities. Teryn was confident enough in herself by all appearances but she could a little too strong-willed to the point of hardheadedness when it came to her opinions, even if proven wrong.
Robert soon arrived after them. If cat's could smile she would have when the young man with the long bangs entered. Out of the entire motley crew that had been brought together by old mysterious Grimbold she liked Robert the most. The young man had an adventurous spirit, and had a way of talking to people, of persuading them to help him in whatever plan he was concocting next. He was easy on the eyes too. If he would just cut back on the drinking.
Next to enter was the amazonian Sloane. The dark-skinned beauty was not only tall but lean and toned, and carried herself with an abundance of confidence. The black feline's green eyes narrowed as she watched the young tattoo artist make her way to the table to join the others. Despite Sloane's love of animals, she and the cat did not get along. Perhaps they were too alike in their near arrogant and vindictive natures.
Cute, petite Cara arrived almost immediately after Sloane. She was a beautiful young twenty-something girl with her brunette hair up in a tight bun, a curvaceous figure, and an enticing British accent. [/INST] Shame she wasn't into girls. Then again, Cara could be more than a little bossy. She and the cat had a complex relationship, one that could be defined as frenemies. One day they could the best of friends while the next day could be determined to claw each other's eyes out.
Angeline followed a few moments after. The rocker chick with the gorgeous blue eyes was the newest member of the group, so new that the black feline didn't truly know that much about her. As for now, they got along just fine.
Then, came Tobias. Six foot tall, handsome and fit, looking as if he just walked out of a Clavin Klein ad. He and the cat didn't get along. She didn't know why, but they seemed to rub one another the wrong away. Still, it didn't stop the little animal from admiring boy from afar.
With the majority of the group here in the cabin, Nina finally decided to let her presence be known to the others. She had been the first to arrive, roughly fifteen minutes earlier than Eddie and Teryn. Having gotten into yet another fight with her mother and stepfather, the nineteen year old had little choice but to sneak out of her house in feline form. With her home towards the opposite end of town it took a while to reach Grimbold's cabin in the woods. When she finally arrived she was more than a little cold, and the old man quickly invited her inside to warm herself by the fireplace. Now, warm and rested, Nina silently padded towards the table, not making a sound as she weaved through the chairs and table legs, rubbing herself against Tobias in greeting. Yeah, they really didn't along, but he was hot. She did the same with Cara and Angel, sliding against their legs underneath the table. Ignoring Sloane and Eddie, Nina made her may to the opposite side of the table to greet Teryn and Robert in the same way, rubbing the side of her sleek little feline body against there legs, her long black tail up in the air. </s>"

Somewhat taken aback by Teryn's reaction, Robert was glad she still poured him some soup. Actions always meant more than words. Technically you are my server right now. He thought as she took his bowl. Her other comments he just ignored. ""I take it you had a rough day then."" He said half to her and half to himself. He still had no idea why she was acting like this. And the different forces inside him, like his curiosity for her and his pride, were a frustrating combination. But tonight he was not in the mood to play this game. So he was glad his friend showed up right on time.
""Thanks"" He told Teryn with a wink, that he assumed would probably piss her off.
Robert made some space for Eddie as he came to sit between him and his soup-server. It was unclear whether Eddie had chosen that position strategically, or whether it was just a random move. But Rob was thankful nevertheless. ""Hey Eddie, good to see you!"" He said as [/INST] he fistumped his homie. ""It was boring as usual. There was a guy who just wouldn't respect the silence rule. So I made him fall from his chair. It made a lot of noise. After that he was too embarrased to say anything else. So yeah.. that was the most exciting part of my day."" He ended with a sigh. It was actually pretty pathetic.
""So how was college today?""
Robert started eating while he listened to Eddie's answer. It worked miracles on his mood. Good food after a long day, nothing better. 
""You should try the soup"" he said to Eddie while glancing at Teryn, who was in a way better position than he was, to help his friend to the delicious meal..
Something rubbed against his leg. Looking under the table, Robert saw the familiar black cat greeting him. ""Hi Nina!"" He said while petting her. It was a weird thing to do with humans, but in animal form it became way more natural. To him at least, it was a form of friendly communication. ""Did Grimbold bring you the clothes? I can get them for you if you want."" </s>"

Daniel wasn't stupid. He had overheard his manager talking to some of the other employees earlier that day about a party. Taking one final glance through the checklist, a sly smirk ghosted his lips as a rebellious thought popped in his head. He didn't know if it was because of his exposure to Grimbold and the group over the years, but his subtle acts of rebellion were becoming more frequent it seemed. Erasing a checkmark, he instead wrote, ""Expired, one box"" next to an item and signed off on the list. Setting the clipboard back in it's rightful spot under the register, Daniel grabbed his jacket and a box from the back before leaving the cafe, locking the door behind him. [/INST] It was a cold February evening, the stars twinkling overhead while the full moon illuminated the cobblestone streets in shimmering shades of silver. Tonight they were to meet at Grimbold's cabin. Checking his watch, he knew he was already running late but he couldn't really bring himself to care. Daniel had been making the trek through the woods at the edge of town for the better part of five years already and figured he had earned himself some leniency at least. Shoving his free hand into his jacket pocket for warmth and adjusting his hold on the box in his hand, Daniel took his time walking, enjoying the silence of the crisp winter evening.
Twenty minutes later found him at the door to the all-too familiar cabin. He knocked twice and waited. It didn't take long for the wizened old man to open the door and let him in with a warm smile. Daniel handed him the box in his arms and hung up his jacket on the hook by the door. At Grimbold's questioning look, Daniel merely shrugged and said,
""A gift from the Cafe,"" as the sweet smell of cakes wafted from the box.

Daniel gave a brief wave in the direction of the group as he took a seat at the table, quietly serving himself a bowl of soup. </s>"

Interacting With: Robert 
""Hi Nina!"" greeted Robert from beneath his bangs as reached down and gave Nina a little pet which she welcomed with a tiny mew. When she first was able to transform into a cat Nina had been hesitant to let anyone touch her. As a rule, the nineteen didn't like to be touched unless the touch was invited. But, then Grimbold picked her up in his warm arms, cuddling and gently rubbing her, and before she knew it Nina was purring. So now, Nina was a little less wary when it came to letting people pet her while a feline.
The one down side to transforming from human to feline was that Nina lost her clothing. She either had to undress beforehand or wiggle her way out of them after transforming. Tonight she has stripped before changing, opening and leaning upon her window so after she could jump out of her room through the window with ease. Nina's bedroom was on the second story of her family's large home so her window lead to the roof. From the roof Nina the cat padded over to the large fir tree beside her home, her footsteps inaudible. An effortless jump from the roof to the closest branch, taking but a couple seconds to steady herself before carefully leaping down to the next branch. And then the next. And the next. Until she was close enough to leap down to the ground below. Nina was well practiced at des [/INST] cending the tree for she had done it quite a few times in the roughly two years she had been blessed by Grimbold's gift.
""Did Grimbold bring you the clothes?"" asked Robert. ""I can get them for you if you want."" Nina had thought about simply remaining in her current shape for the rest of her time in the cabin tonight, perhaps in curled up in someone's lap. But, after a moment decided she should join the others at the table properly.
Walking away from Robert and the the others with her long towards the shadowy room where Grimbold kept the extra clothing, her thin tail in the air, Nina began to revert to her human form. Her figure started to lengthen. Silky black fur seemly gave way to her natural lightly tanned Caucasian skin tone, except for the top of her head. Upon her head feline fur turned to human hair and grew and an uncanny rate. By the time Daniel Reyes entered the cabin and made his way to the table Nina was fully transformed and quite naked. Her backside towards the table as she sashayed slowly toward the room. Her long dark hair tickled the middle of her bare back, the light from the fireplace giving her heart-shaped derriere a beautiful orange glow. Her hips swayed flirtatiously with every movement of her endless legs. Looking back over her shoulder she smirked at Robert. ""I can handle it, Mr Fox,"" she said sweetly. And then, Nina disappeared into the room. </s>"

Sky washed her hands in the bathroom sink before looking at herself in the mirror. Moving a red lock of hair behind her ear she looked carefully at herself. Was she really turning 22 in six days? ""I'm glad my twenties are looking better than my teen years."" Sky thought to herself before leaving the bathroom.
In moment she was sitting down again at the table and it wasn't long before everyone started to arrive. She herself had gotten to the cabin early as her shift at work had been from 8am to 5pm. Not the best hours in the world due to how much of a night owl she is but they worked for tonight. Now-a-days she found herself waiting for nights like this. While she saw a lot of these guys around town and talked to each other often, it was different being together as a group.
Serving herself some of the soup Grimbold made she started to eat. The soup [/INST] was nice with how cold it was getting outside. The trek up here could be very cold at times. To her the cold was welcomed as the heat and harshness of summer made her annoyed. The soup was a nice way to warm up though and made sure no one was hungry when the meeting came around.
As time went on she was sitting next to Sloane and across from Foxy, Eddie, and Terry. Nina, Angel, and Cara sitting on the side of the table she was on. Toby took a seat amoung the group and it seemed like everyone was almost here.
Sky watched as a black cat came out from under the table and transformed back into Nina. Being in the group, she's started to not really mind if some became randomly naked around her. It wasn't like you could transform and still have clothes on. When she did transform however she didn't want anyone to really see her when she untransformed.

Sloane had been relatively quiet while people entered, occasionally throwing a nod at the newest person to enter the cabin and listening to the conversations around her. Until, oddly, the table fell relatively silent and she cocked an eyebrow, spoon of soup half way to her mouth. She lowered it back into the bowl and glanced over at Nina, who had taken on her human form. Damn, she was gorgeous if insufferable. The thought brought a smirk to her face, and Sloane watched unapologetically as Nina disappeared into the next room. Am [/INST] used but rolling her eyes, SLoane turned back to the table just as Sky spoke up.
""Long,"" she answered after clearing her throat. ""I just got off the bus an hour ago."" It wasn't news to anyone that Sloane tended to be in and out of Tallshade, her artwork one of the very few things that put the small town on the map. If it weren't for Grimbold and the family she made here, Sloane wouldn't still be here at all. She glanced to Sky finally, reminding herself of a third reason to stick around. She sighed, a little tired, a little exasperated with herself and leaned forward again. ""What about you?"" </s>"

As the others soon piled into the cabin, Angel regarded them somewhat curiously as she ate. Tobias entered soon after her, standing nearby rather than sitting. The guy ticked all the boxes for tall, dark and handsome. However, he took the 'dark' bit just a little too far into the realm of mystery. Fair enough that she herself didn't know much about him - Angel hadn't been in the town for three months, if that. However, she had the strange inkling he was a mystery to the rest of the group as well.
Cara seemed to be the closest to him, from what she could tell - but then again, Cara was a total sweetheart in Angel's eyes. On her first meeting she'd been surprised to find a fellow English gal among all the yanks. Not that she had many ties left to England, other than an insane father and dead mother, but Hell, the surprise was a nice one all the same.
""Girl knows how to put up her own in an argument too."" She added as an afterthought.
As for the others, they seemed cool. Robert was definitely someone to rock out with sometime. Sloane - obviously an epic artist, if her tattoos were anything to judge her by. Eddie... well, he hadn't really made many impressions on her, good or bad.
Grabbing a breadroll from the middle of the table, Angel broke it in half as she continued her own recap of her new ""family"". Teryn... Hmm. Well, the less said about her, the better. Fair [/INST] to say, their first meeting hadn't gone swimmingly. In Angel's eyes, anyhow.
Glancing up as Daniel entered, followed swiftly by Skylar, she sent the latter a bright smile. Skylar was another friend she had made swiftly, finding her more than easy to talk to. As for Daniel - well, therein lay another enigma. The boy was harder to figure out than Toby.
And then Nina appeared - or rather, made herself more known. In the most revealing manner possible.
Now, Angel wasn't all too used to the whole shape-shifting thing. She'd shifted all of five times, and she was still learning how to run properly on all fours without eating a face full of dirt each time. Additionally, the whole naked thing was a surprise.
Yes, she had foolishly believed that clothes shifted with the body, Harry Potter style, because hey, with all the magic shit she'd been introduced to, it wasn't too hard to believe. Therefore, it had been surprising.
As it was now, seeing Nina's perfectly shaped ass staring at all of them. An unpleasant sight? Not really. It wasn't the first naked girl Angel had seen before. But for it to appear rather suddenly while enjoying a bowl of soup and a half-eaten bread roll, it caused Angel to avert her eyes for a few moments, stifling a giggle. Because when shown a full moon, naturally one has to find humour in it.
""Jeez, I really need to get used to this whole ""going commando"" thing we got going here."" She said with a grin to Cara, sitting beside her. </s>"

The feeling of fur brushing Cara's bare leg caused her to almost jolt in her seat. Cara knew she should've expected it, seeing as she's known this group of misfits for almost a year by now. Instead of peering down under the table, Cara moved her leg back in response, knowing that the furry creature below had already gone to greet other people in her odd way.
Robert's greeting to the feline shifter confirmed Cara's suspicions, a grin on her face as she realised that Nina would not have any clothes on if she shifted back in front of everyone. The situation would possibly be hilarious, seeing everyone's reactions. Cara snickered at the thought. Over time, Cara had come to love the group as her family, trusting them more than her true family back home even though she's only known the shifting family for a year.
Just like how [/INST] Cara's imagination played out, Nina transformed back to her human self, quite proudly in front of everyone. Naked, just like the day she was born.
Cara was proudly a straight woman, liking her men more. But of course, no one could deny that Nina looked great. And she knew it too, with her confident stride and flirtatious attitude towards Robert. Supressing a snort as Nina returned to the room to change, Cara turned to Angel as she spoke up. ""Jeez, I really need to get used to this whole ""going commando"" thing we got going here.""
""Takes a while to get used to,"" Cara admitted. When she had shifted for the first time, the girl was lucky enough to have done it in the comfort of her own home, to try and test out her magical powers as soon as Gandalf - Grimbold - let her leave the library. ""But hey, as long as we don't follow in Nina's footsteps out with the normal people, we should be good."" </s>"

Eddie was busy recalling the highlights of his day to Robert, including but not limited to: giving static charge to every tool his teacher was about to pick up, skipping a class to test the new treads on his bike (the trip out here tonight was a breeze), and getting closer to one of his classmates. She was a tomboy redhead, and Eddie was smitten. He kept using his power to zap her and himself whenever they passed tools (""Wow, I guess there's some sparks between us!"")
Once Eddie realized most everyone had stopped talking besides him, he turned to see what they were looking at. ""I can handle it, Mr Fox."" Eddie blushed and immediately looked at Robert to see his reaction. Eddie hadn't even known Nina was here, but that wasn't surprising. There w [/INST] ere people he didn't get along with in the group, but Eddie trusts Grimbold, and Grimbold trusts them, so they can't be that bad. Plus, he had people like Robert and Sky to hang out with.
Eddie's mind came back to Nina transforming in front of everyone. All of them could change, under the same restrictions, but still. Eddie had only had to take his animal form twice. Once when his bike broke halfway, and the only way to be on time was to hide the bike and his clothes and come back for them later. The second was... a little more embarrassing. But that's a story for another time. Both times, though, Eddie made sure was completely covered in shadow before reverting.

Terry was slightly taken aback by Robert's thanks. ""You're welcome, I guess,"" she said as she rolled her eyes. She was not used to such forward behavior, especially since she scared most people away. Much to her relief, Robert was busy talking to Eddie now and left her alone.
If there was anyone who knew Terry well enough, they would notice that her face lit up slightly when Sloane arrived. ""Hey Sloane,"" she said with a small wave. They didn't talk too much, but she always felt a little better once Sloane is there. She was interesting to talk to and even Terry needed some social interaction once in a while.
Then a black cat finally made her presence known to the group. The cat made her way around [/INST] the table, rubbing against the legs of people she liked (or maybe was just okay with). Terry fought the urge to pet the cat when it approached her. The cat was a real person after all. That would be weird. Robert seemed to have no qualms with it though. Then suddenly, the cat turned into a Nina Constantine, a naked Nina Constantine. Terry's cheeks slightly reddened and she began to feel jealous of the girl's body. It was so beautiful and smooth. And the confidence that she wore with it...
After what felt like eternity, Terry finally peeled her eyes away and Nina had went into the other room. Shit, was she really staring?
More people have seemed to arrive. Or were they here before that whole scene? She wasn't paying attention nor did she really care.

Daniel took his time with his bowl of soup, glancing around at the others at the table as he did. Everyone was like a giant dysfunctional family, more so than any family he had ever had living back in France. He must have been almost the last to arrive as he noticed everyone was here but Nick. Daniel hadn't realized he had been running that late. Maybe everyone else had simply gotten here early. He reached across the table to the bread basket and grabbed himself a crusty roll, perfect to go with the hearty soup. Daniel allowed himself a small smile as he ripped off a piece and popped it in his mouth. Nothing beat the taste of fresh bread. Not nearly as good as the bread back home but the local bakery here definitely knew what they were doing.
At the sudden silence that fell around the room, Daniel looked up and nearly choked on his bread. ""Oh la vache,"" he stuttered out as he swallowed. Mademoiselle Nina just made herself very publicly known and Daniel quickly averted his eyes out of respect for the lady. He realized Nina liked to flaunt her body on purpose but Daniel was still a gentleman. Instead he busied himself with observing everyone else's reactions. Skylar didn't seem bothered much by the situation. It was expected after all. They had all been [/INST] warned in the beginning by Grimbold that this would happen should they transform back into their human forms. Sloane openly stared and Angel stifled a giggle while making a joking remark to Cara. Cara didn't seem too bothered either, just like Skylar, and simply continued conversing with Angel after giving Nina a brief glance. Edward blushed and looked down, much like Daniel had, then turned to Robert. From Daniel's seat at the table, he couldn't quite tell how Tobias and Robert were reacting to Nina's performance but he was quite curious what was going on in Robert's mind. Her little act had been obviously directed at him after all. It wasn't too difficult to tell the two had something between them, be it one-sided or mutual. Lastly, Daniel's gaze fell upon Teryn. Her cheeks were dusted pink with a slight blush but she didn't look away the entire time Nina sauntered across the room. ""You're staring,"" Daniel whispered to Teryn with a chuckle. Only when conversation had returned to the table and Teryn shook herself out of her daze did Daniel conclude that Nina must have disappeared into the back room where the spare clothes were kept. He shook his head with a laugh as he returned to his bowl, finishing the last spoonfuls of soup. He leaned back in his chair with a contented sigh as he munched on the rest of his bread. </s>"

The sweet smell of baked pastries filled the cabin, and although Tobias had already ate it was hard to resist. After all, the cafe usually sold these cakes in small pieces, and they cost enough to to buy a meal or two elsewhere. The Castle Street Café tried to justify it through one hundred percent fresh ingredients or something, but it was probably just fancy vocab so hipsters would recommend buying an overpriced snack to their friends and family. ""Thanks Daniel. Real nice of ya."" 
Though it seemed Daniel was averting his gaze from something. Tobias looked in the direction Daniel was avoiding, and it was naked Nina. ""Oh come on...."" Did she really have to use her powers now? It was hardly necessary to transform in front of [/INST] everyone, this was just wanton usage.. She literally just had to walk a few more steps and there would be an empty room where she could change.

Hell, Terry was staring for quite some time. Tobias didn't want to jump to conclusions, as it might have been just pure shock, but it certainly seemed that she was staring out of lust. Yeah, Tobias was a guy, he couldn't say there was no impure thoughts, but even he and Daniel restrained themselves better than Terry had.

As she was about to respond back to Sloane she watched once again as Sloane and Toby didn`t get along. As embarrassing as it is sometimes Sloane did have a point though. At some point, unless you were new, you`ve seen a majority of the group naked in some way. Some were more open with it, she however wasn`t as confident. It was her childhood that she could blame for that one. The confidence issue was something she still couldn`t quite get around. A lot of them did have reason to be so confident however, they weren`t exactly hard on the eyes. ""You do have a very valid point""
Reaching to the pastries she took a piece for herself. ""Thank you Daniel,"" Sky said to him with an upbeat attitude before turning back to Sloane. ""I`m sorry that it took so long to get back here, it must be a real drag sometimes."" She replied and ate a spoonful of her soup [/INST] before continuing.

Seeing the people that came in her powers sometimes seemed to become hyper sensitive. It was hard to not use them at times. It did make her feel guilty because even though she would find out ways to help them, she also gave them to paranoia to worry about.

The girl definitely stirred up the group, with all the looks and comments that followed her. Listening to both Toby and sloane giving their opinions on this matter, he found that he actually agreed with Sloane. ""hear hear."" He added to her statement as he raised his rumflask, before taking a sip.

Once he saw that everybody finished eating, he loudly cleared his throat and sat up straight. With his hands he held on to the corners of the table. ""Boys! Girls! I want to welcome you again tonight on our full moon meeting. I hope you enjoyed the soup and tried the cakes that Daniel was so kind to bring.""
 His deep voice bellowed through the room.
He paused and made sure everybody was paying attention.
""I'm also glad to see the newest member of our family is fitting right in. I expect everybody to make her feel at home. We look after each other.""
From Angel, he shifted his attention to Nick who had just entered. He just looked at the boy in silence for a second, as if to ask why he was late, and what he was planning with the rabbit. But he didn't say anything about it. Then continu [/INST] ed his speech to the group.
""We'll be visiting the shrine tonight. But before we do, I'm pretty sure you're all curious to hear what our next task is."" He cleared his throat again.
""For each of you, I have a person that needs to be brought bad luck. Whatever you do to him or her is up to you, but they need to stay in their house next saturday. They're not supposed to go out. You could make them feel bad or scared, you could lock them in. Have them break their legs. It's up to you. But they can't leave the house coming saturday.""
Grimbold looked around the room to make sure everybody understood what he was saying.
""You can help each other. Ask others for help if you need it.
These are your targets..."" Grimbold started calling the names of everybody in the group. After every name, there was the name of their target. Some were familiar. Some weren't.
""Oh, and one more thing"" Grimbold added after he had finished the list. ""Keep your saturday evening free. You might get a phonecall with a request. Accept the offer.""
He gave them some time to take it in.
With a much softer voice he ended: finish your soup, if you still need to. Sorry Nina, but we're changing again. Tonight we're learning. We'll be heading out in ten minutes.” </s>"

Terry was taken aback by the sound of Daniel's voice. ""I... whatever..."" she muttered back, unable to come up with a decent excuse or defense. Her face quickly returned to its normal color and she pretended as if nothing had happened.
Luckily for her, everyone had apparently arrived and Grimbold was starting the meeting officially. She waited to hear what her mission was. Apparently they were trying to keep people inside their homes on Saturday. Another random task that somehow was a part of something bigger. The person she was assigned to was Ms. Victoria Young, a girl in her English class. She had nothing against the poor girl, she rarely had anything against her victims, but it was a mission. Now, how was she going to keep her inside? She would prefer to do it without hurting anyone but if it came to it, she wouldn't hesitate.
When Grimbold announced t [/INST] hat they were going outside to ""learn"", Terry frowned. ""Why did I ever agree to this?"" she wondered, feeling exasperated. There were other ways she could have been spending her Monday night, like work on that 20 page research paper due next week. ""Well, no use complaining now.""
She went into the other room and decided to remove her clothes there before changing into her animal form. Unlike Nina, she wasn't going to show off her body to the entire group. After taking off her clothes, she was already starting to shiver. She quickly transformed into a raven so she didn't have to deal with the cold anymore. Even though it felt weird the first few times she has done it, she was quite used to transforming now. It was like putting on a sweater or something. She flew out the window and perched out on the branch of a nearby tree. She waited for the rest of the group to come out as well and wondered what Grimbold had in store for them. </s>"

As everyone reached for the box of cakes and pastries that he had so kindly ""borrowed"" from the Cafe, Daniel nodded his acknowledgement to each member of the group in turn as they either verbally thanked him or otherwise made some gesture of thanks in his direction. Even the simple act of thanking him brought a warm feeling to his chest. It gave him that sense of belonging that he had longed for all his life. Even though he didn't interact much with the group, he felt more at home here, in this cabin in the woods, with these people he called family, than he ever has growing up in France. Daniel glanced towards the door as Nick finally made his appearance. Without so much as a reason for his tardiness, Nick simply plopped down on the floor. The familiar pang of jealously rose up in Daniel. To be so carefree must be a blessing. However, Daniel quickly quelled his emotions, merely glad that everyone was finally here.
Finishing the bread roll in his hand, Daniel's attention was captured once more as Grimbold stood and made his announcement. Simultaneously excited and anxious to hear what was in store for them, Daniel held onto every word that left the man's mouth. A wicked smirk graced Daniel's features, a rare expr [/INST] ession for the young man to show. His target was none other than Monsieur Brian Cobald, the manager of the Castle Street Cafe and the source of Daniel's frustration while at work. The irony was almost laughable. Ready to finally stretch his wings, Daniel stood up from the table and left the cabin. Deciding to leave the privacy of the spare room for the girls, he walked around back behind the cabin to his usual shadowed alcove nestled between two large oak trees. Daniel quickly stripped and transformed. Lean muscled arms gave way to long leathery black wings while smooth white skin was covered in course fur. Smell and hearing became amplified to their maximum potential while vision, not so much. He didn't realize it until he transformed for the first time that there was a very literal meaning behind being ""as blind as a bat"". But the freedom of being able to fly was more than he could ever ask for. Daniel the Bat gave his wings one good stretch before taking flight, swooping back around to the front of the cabin, and hanging upside down from a branch near the door. He noticed a raven on a branch not too far from his own tree and figured Teryn must have not wasted any time in transforming either. If he could smile right now he would. They were both impatient people it seemed. </s>"

Interacting With: Sloane and Grimbold

Once she heard Sloane`s response Grimbold called their attention and she looked over at the older man. She had a great deal of respect for him. Even if their missions were somewhat weird sometimes, they always had a reason behind them. There wasn`t much room to argue when they had chosen this path themselves. It was exactly a thing you could walk away from once you started it. He started to speak about their mission assignment, eagerly she listened to they would be doing. Apparently they were going to be given someone they had to keep indoors on Saturday. The next instructions that they themselves were to be free on Saturday as well. For her this was manageable but she didn`t know about the others who had careers to worry about. It`d probably be more difficult to move things around. Once again however, they had picked this life, there wasn`t any backing out.
The person she was assigned was a man named Henry Johnson. At the present moment she didn`t know who this man was or how she was going to know who he was. There would be many ways for her to meet him, the question of who he was, was kind of intimidating however. This was a small town, everyone knew mostly everyone, or at le [/INST] ast who they were. This guy would either be a new resident or not a very known one. ""I get Mr.John Doe, let`s see where this leads I guess. I do know that paranoia will be what keeps him out of the public.""

Standing up she walked into the spare room once Terry had left as a raven and closed the door. She wasn`t the kind of girl to shift butt naked in front of a group of people. At this point she really should be used to it. This sadly wasn`t the case. Sky walked over to the window in the room and opened it enough for her to be able to get through. Taking off her clothes she put them in a pile on top of the dresser next to a clothing rack and shifted into the barn owl she called her other form. Taking a moment to shake out her feathers she flapped up and flew out of the room through the window.
The feeling of being able to fly wasn`t something she`d ever be able to get used too. It felt amazing to have such control over something that was so hard to do as a human. The small frame of her animal self also proved to make flying even easier for her. It was one out of the many things that made her life here feel so much better than the life that she put behind her. The person she was before she came here in her opinion was dead, and she was more than overjoyed by it. </s>"

Lame... Ofcourse they were going out. Well at least he could be Fox! His favorite alter ego. And derping as animals was always fun. The target he was assigned to was a problem though. He knew her name as she visited the library occasionally. His power was straightwforward enough to actually help her sprain an ankle. But she seemed like an innocent girl. She didn't deserve that. He had to find another way. But that was for later to worry about.
Robert stood up and stretched his arms up and out while yawning. After a last sip of rum, he put his flask on the table and started transforming. No need to change in secret somewhere. His clothes would pretty much fall off of him when he shrunk to fox form.
Though the entire body transforming was an unsettling feeling, the weirdest part was how the skull changed form. The protruding of the jaw and nose into a snout. Rob was pretty sure he could hear a grinding sound as the parietal and [/INST] frontal bone in his skull flattened. The extension of the ears and the growing of the tail and fur were a more comfortable part of the transformation. He liked having a tail a lot. Within seconds the boy had seemingly dissapeared, only leaving behind the things he was wearing, as they fell to the ground.
And there was that.
The Fantastic mister fox wiggled around to find it's way out of the pile of clothes that he was in. His snout found an exit through the neck of his sweater. The struggle was short and easy, and within seconds he had escaped his cotton cage.
Smells were the first thing that came to him. everything was so strong. Plus the sounds. He could hear a mouse walking outside the cabin. And some bird flapping it's wings, probably Terry or Sky.
He jumped on the table to oversee how the rest was doing with their transformations. Then he rolled around a few times. And hugged his own tail. Being an animal had something liberating. You could act like one. </s>"

""Edward Hansen, Emily O'Reilly"" Eddie's face turned beet red at the mention of his college crush's name after his own. He had to figure out a way to keep her at her house on Saturday? This mission might be difficult. Maybe Robert can give me an idea? He's good at that. Or maybe I could ask Cara or Sky for advice. They're girls, they'll probably know what would keep them in on a Saturday. Oh well, at least we have almost a week.
Eddie couldn't help but smile though, at the mention of learning something from Grimbold. The curiosity was almost overwhelming, and Grimbold was such a mysterious old man. We'll know soon enough.
Eddie's thoughts continued to race as he went outside, to ""his spot"", around the corner from the door. He moved autonomously, as his mind was busy. Although everyone had seen pretty much everyone naked, he still didn't want undress in front of anyone if there [/INST] was no need or urgency. He also couldn't just transform and walk out of the clothes, like some of the others. A disadvantage of picking a larger animal. He had tried once, but his shirt and underwear were especially impossible to remove as a dog, and even more awkward when he changed back. He moved a flat rock he kept for just such an occasion, leaned against the cabin over another rock. His clothes should be safe there.
Before long he ventured back around the corner, and sat at the door, transformed into a dog. Eddie had always had a deep love for dogs, but never had the chance to keep one. And so when he met with Grimbold the first time, he knew immediately what form he wanted. A German Shepherd, like one he used to see at the pet store as a child.
As Eddie thought about his first meeting with Grimbold, his tail began to wag absentmindedly. When he remembered that they were going to get a new lesson from Grimbold, it doubled it's pace. </s>"

By the time Nick had entered with his friend - at the sight of the fluffy rabbit, naturally Angel's mind went into hyperdrive over how gosh darn cute it was - she and most of the others had finished up their meal. As Grimbold began talking, she finished off the rest of her cake, listening carefully.
On her first meeting last month, naturally she'd been skittish. Angel only turned the once before that meeting, and was so damned nervous changing with the others. The Shrine was a bit disconcerting too, but she just told herself to think about the shrines in Skyrim. They were totally normal in the Elder Scrolls Universe! I mean, they usually had necromancers and shit nearby too, but whatever... magic is magic.
This second time was a lot easier - not only did she know more of what to do, but she was more at home with the others. Friends with most of them at that - as Grimbold had mentioned, they looked after her pretty well.
However, last time, she hadn't been told to use her powers on another human - this human happened to be one Garrett Russell. She knew who he was - his older brother, Miguel, sat next to her in most of her Psychology lectures, and the pair were even friends. From her short time in Tallshade, she'd quickly found out Garrett had quite the reputation for himself; the 17 year old, still being in High School, was a notorious party goer and stereotypical jock. The few times she'd visited the Garrett house, either for parties or study sessions, Garrett had flirted quite nonchalantly with her, much to his brother's ire. What he lacked severely in brains the kid made up for in looks, height and muscle, so any arguments with his distinctly smaller and nerdier older brother didn't last very long.
Safe to [/INST] say Angel wasn't too impressed by him, despite his efforts.
As for her job on keeping him indoors... that would be a tricky one. Being an ardent party goer and social butterfly, it was highly likely he'd be doing something Saturday night. Was there a High School football game on? He was on the team... hmm. It would either be that or some party. A guy like Garrett didn't stay in on the weekend.
Deciding to think on it later - and perhaps getting some help from a more experienced member of the group - Angel stood up with the others as Grimbold announced their plans for the night: Shrine Time with the Animal Fun-Time group. Huzzah.
Following Skye's departure from the back room - in the form of a gorgeous black owl - Angel entered, stripping her clothes quickly in case somebody else wanted some privacy. Underneath her fairly dark rock attire, Angel chuckled as she looked at her very not-rock underwear: White briefs and bra with multi-coloured paw prints all over them. Nice.
Taking them off too and folding them with the rest of her clothes, Angel shivered as she began to change. Suddenly, her head was elongating into a snout; teeth and nails elongating and sharpening into claws and fangs; and ebony fur sprouting all over her body. Eyes now taking on a pale golden glow, Angel looked down at her paws.
""Woo! Change successful! Now to try and walk straight and avoid eating dirt..."" She thought to herself, then carefully walking to the door, scraping at it until it swung open. Barking lightly as she saw the others, Angel picked up her pace, trotting in a somewhat straight line outside.
Rather than going straight to the Shrine, she sat outdoors, gazing at the moon while she waited for Cara... who could potentially want a lift in her snake form.

""Shit, I don't know how you deal with that,"" Sloane had sympathized to Sky, scowling a bit. The young woman was so reserved and quiet; Sloane couldn't imagine her handling something willing to bring the building down to avoid treatment. Even though she cared for Sky, she still wasn't the type to worry, and she offered a helpless shrug. The worst she had to deal with were cheapskates and drunk frat boys that can't sit still, and she said as much as Nick was coming. ""We'll tell you when you're older,"" she had teased, throwing a wink in his direction. It was soon after that she finished her soup and Grimbold spoke up.
At the mention of their newest member, Sloane had glanced over at Angel; new, but he was right, fitting right into the ba [/INST] nter and atmosphere. She even offered a smile in agreement (though it was quickly gone). Then the mentor got down to business: Sloane didn't recognize the name. So not a local, she thought, green eyes narrowing as her next thoughts jumped to the university. And the artist was just fine with leaving her Saturday open; she enjoyed quiet nights at home, especially after being gone all week. Once Grimbold was done speaking, she popped another pastry into her mouth as she stood up.
She disappeared into another room, her shirt coming up and over head before she pushed the door almost closed (hooves couldn't open a door very well after all).

A heavy sigh escaped Cara's lips, dropping her spoon beside the bowl she was once having soup from. It wasn't that she didn't enjoy changing into a snake and hanging out with the group of misfits in their animal form, it's just the fact that it had been a year since she had gotten her powers yet she still couldn't adjust to the no-limb situation. Cara eyed Angel as she entered the room to change into her coyote form. At least the newbie was lucky enough to have four legs instead of none. She waited for Angel to leave the room, deciding to take the moment to think about who her target was.
Janet Garrison. The name sounded familiar, like a prickling at the back of her mind, but she wasn't very sure where she heard it. Cara mentally flicked through a list of people from her class, crossing out each name and face as she tried narrowing down on the familar Miss Garrison.
'Ah, now I remember...'
Janet was one of the many girls hidden away at the back of the lecture hall, the shy and quiet type. Possibly smart too, Cara guessed. She didn't know much about the shy classmate, other than her age - twenty one - and which dorm she lived in. It was possible for Cara to use her usual scare tactics on the girl, maybe amped up a bit just to ensure she wouldn't leave her room on Saturday. Of course, Cara didn't want to completely traumatise the girl, but there was nothing she could do about it. A job was a job.
Cara got up slowly as she saw Sloane coming from the direction of the room, taking it as her cue to get ready. Leaving the door partially open behind her, Cara immediately started on he [/INST] r clothes. One by one, articles of clothing would drop to the ground, before a naked Cara would pick it back up and make sure to fold them carefully, the coldness of the room raising goosebumps on her bare flesh. She was always peculiar about her clothes, wanting everything to be pristine and perfect.
You could even say she was a bit of a control freak when it came to looking her best.
Not that she would ever admit it out loud.
Next, Cara readied herself for her change, sitting down with her legs pressed together and her arms against her sides. It was much easier and less painful for her to do so, as the scales slowly enveloped her skin and merged her limbs to her body. Cara's height shrunk even further and her eyes changing from the brown hue to an obsidian black, her eyelids disappearing completely until she finally took on the appearance of a Mexican Black Kingsnake.
Now was the hard part. Cara had left just enough of a gap for her to slither past, but she had to make sure she wouldn't make a fool out of herself by getting tangled into her own body while doing so. Slowly, but surely, Cara slid across the ground and towards the others, letting them know the room was empty before leaving through the front door, finding Angel waiting outside.
Cara would've smiled if she could, but she simply hissed letting the coyote know of her presence before she climbed - for the lack of a better word - up Angel's body and looped herself around her neck, securing herself to the coyote's body. It was a bit of a dangerous move, but Cara would try not to strangle the newbie. Well, as long as she didn't trip over her paws and send Cara flying into the air. </s>"

Finally, Grimbold spoke up, telling them of the task he had for them. They were to keep someone inside their house next Saturday, either physically or mentally. And something about a call, perhaps Grimbold would check on them that evening. Tobias frowned as he wondered how he would keep his target inside his house. His power was predicative in nature, unlike most of the group, who had something that was more active in nature. His target didn't really help matters either, it was his landlord of all people. Tobias doubted his animal form, the raccoon could do much with the task Grimbold assigned him.
Tobias was sure he'd have to do something physical to keep his landlord inside. Hopefully it wouldn't have to come to something dras [/INST] tic, but he had a week to figure it out. In the meantime, he should probably change into his animal. ""I always hated this part...""  The transformation wasn't painful, but it felt strange. Yes, Tobias had changed before, but it never became normal to him. The whole losing all your clothes thing was very inconvenient, but he supposed even magic had it's limits.
Now a raccoon, Tobias slowly backed out of what was his shirt. He'd learned from his first few attempts that moving forward just usually led to his head getting stuck on his shirt, and Tobias would be running around with it stuck until he transformed back. Not like it obscured his vision, but it would ruin his t-shirt and people's attention would be drawn to him. Tobias then began his way to the shrine, not wishing to waste anymore time. </s>"
483,"<s>[INST] Slightly uphill, a silhouette appeared in front of the big full moon that shone behind it.
A wolf, with thick grey fur, was waiting for the other animals to follow him. Once they were all together, he led them up the mountain, over a hidden path, through the forest.
The Shrine was waiting for them. A circle of large hewn stones, with a stone that could resemble an altar in the middle. At the side of the circle, there were some other stone structures, leaning against the mountainside. Altogether it could remind one of an ancient druidic build. A small sister of stonehenge perhaps. But much less known ofcourse. It was highly likely nobody else but Grimbold and the critter family knew about this place.
The wolf made a circling movement with his head, indicating the others to form a circle within the circle of stones.
On the ground around the altar, some lines and circles had been drawn in the earth. Other lines were made up of different kinds of powders. One black, white, oker.
As the wolf slowly walked towards the altar, he started changing. The fur transformed into a grey cloak. Once Grimbold arrived at the center of the circle, he was completely in human form again.
On the altar, a swan had been waiting. Not making a sound, not startled by all the movements around her. She just lay there, seeming to be at total peace, while she looked around at the other critters.
Grimbold wasn't happy with what he was about to do. It wasn't the first time, and it wouldn't be the last. But he did what he had to do. And his pupils needed to learn, because they had a long road ahead of them. While he was getting old.
He took his dagger out and held it up with both hands, blade pointing downwards at the swan.
""Opako senar, hambra manu, se [/INST] pa kharta latangra ghudul""
With one swift strike, Grimbold brought the blade down. It struck the swan on her back, right between her wings. Only faintly, you could hear the swan gasping for air one last time, before she lost strength in her neck, and her head fell onto the altar.
An eerie silence struck the forest for a few seconds. No birds, no insects. No sounds. Nothing.
Then vaguely, a black smoke started coming from the swan. As if the entire beasts body was evaporating. The feathers melted into a heavy black smoke that was almost liquid. And eventually, the entire swan dissapeared. Thick black smoke rolled over the side of the altar and onto the ground, from where the swan had just dissapeard. The smoke spread across the forest floor, before slowly evaporating into nothingness. On the altar only the skeleton of the swan remained.
Grimbold muttered some more words in an unknown language, as if he was paying his respect to the dead creature's body. Then he started collecting the bones in a bag, leaving the skull for last.
He looked around the circle.
“That was all for today”
He nodded in the direction of the cabin, the sign to head back.

After that Grimbold had changed into wolf from once again, and they all went back to the cabin. He didn't care to explain what just had happened, or even why it had. Once people had dressed themselves again, they started leaving. Heading home probably. Grimbold stood at the door, the same he had when they had entered. He greeted everyone, and watched them leave.

The next day, the sun rose above the horizon, meeting a cloudless blue sky. This time of the year, morning did allow the sun to shine her light on tallshade for a few hours, before the sun dissapeared behind the mountain. </s>"

While rubbing the sleep out of his face, he walked to the kitchen in his underwear to make himself some oatmeal. While the water was boiling, he looked in the mirror. A leaf was still stuck in his messy hair. With his fingers he combed his hair a bit, so that he would at least look good enough to go to work today. Not that he was planning to put much more effort into that. Well, getting dressed perhaps.
fifteen minutes later, Robert was walking towards the library, enjoying the only sunlight that would be touching his skin today. This sure was a good town for lightsensitive gingers.

The bright green numbers that read 7:34am seemed to glare at him in the darkness of the room. Seeing as he probably wasn't going to get anymore sleep today, Daniel forced himself out of bed and started his usual morning routine. Thinking back on the night before was useless as it didn't make much sense to him then so why would it now? Grimbold had told them they would be learning something new at the Shrine but Daniel had yet to figure out exactly what that was. After he had dressed and cleaned himself up, he made his way to the kitchenette and prepared himself a bagel with cream cheese. Glancing at the clock again told him it was now 8:02am. He didn't have to be at work until 9 today but figured he could show up a little early. He had nothing better to do anyway. Maybe he could catch his manager before everyone else showed up for their shift. He did have a mission after all. Grabbing his jacket, Daniel headed out the door, deciding to finish his bagel on the go.
As he reached the Castle Street Cafe, a smile broke out as Daniel noticed that Brian was indeed already there.

He found Brian near the register looking over the inventory checklist from last night. Looking up as he noticed Daniel's presence, Brian gave him a quick glance before returning his attention to the clipboard in his hand. It was brief but it was all the time Daniel needed to notice the discoloration around Brian's left eye. Releasing a low whistle, Daniel made himself give off the impression of concern. ""That's some shiner you got there, Brian. Rough night?"" Grabbing his head, Brian winced and grunted out, ""Yeah, some jackwagon decided he had something to prove after drinking too much.

""Last night was strange, at least, stranger than usual,"" Terry thought to herself as she walked to school. She had never seen Grimbold do anything like it and wondered why they all had to be there to watch. He said that they were ""learning"" something, but he didn't even bother to explain what that something was. It had to be some sort of ritual, that much was obvious, but the purpose of the ritual remained unclear.
Teryn had walked all the way to school only to find out that her teacher had cancelled class. She was somewhat annoyed that she woke up early just to attend this morning class, but at the same time, she enjoyed having the day off. ""Hm... so what do I do now?"" she wondered as she sat on the bench outside her locked classroom. ""Ah... I know.""
She got up, grabbed her stuff, then made her way to the infamous Castle Street Cafe. Students loved to come here to drink coffee, study, and hang out. But unlike them, she had a different reason for going though: She was going to ask for a certain bat boy's help.
She didn't like asking for help, that was for sure. [/INST] But it was kind of hard to keep a person indoors all day with only breezes. Daniel had the powers to give people headaches, which combined with her breezes might be able to keep her target inside. She thought about turning back and maybe going to the library instead to work on her report. She didn't want to owe anybody anything. But soon enough she was already outside the door of the cafe.
Terry internally groaned as she saw that there was already a line at the cafe. She fidgeted with her bag,made sure to not make eye contact with any of the other customers, and shuffled up the line whenever it was possible. A few stiff moments later, she found herself in front of the line at last. ""I'd like a small chai latte please,"" she said to the man taking her order. She paid what she felt was overpriced for a small cup of latte, but that was capitalism. ""Teryn,"" she answered when he asked for her name.

Interacting with frat boy no. 1

Death. Sloane had practically grown up with it, looming over her and stealing from her, a constant reminder that her life would one day end. And although she had remained still as a deer, watching Grimbold take the life of the swan stirred a familiar fear within her and her little doe heart had quickly and loudly thumped against her ribcage. She had been with the Mentor for years and she had never seen a display like that, and the unfamiliarity only added to her anxiety. Needless to say, the walk back to the cabin was a somber one. Sloane had followed the little pack back to the cabin, gaze forward and hooves steady.
Once they had returned and dressed, Sloane remained quiet. It wasn't uncommon for her, but everyone had shared the heavy atmosphere before leaving one by one. And, she wasn't one to drink much at all, but that night Sloane had stopped at a bar. The young woman had went home with a stranger--some grad student with clear brown eyes--only to rush home the next the morning. She had clients (and a h [/INST] angover) to attend to, after all.
And that's where her day really began, but she found herself being distracted even as she worked. She sipped tea between clients, and they were few and far between. Sloane got about as much business as you'd expect in a small town, but she got by. ""It's done,"" she said, leaning away from her client and standing to her full height. Her open-toed, 4"" heels weren't exactly business standard, but who were they going to tell? The owner?
After checking out his new, sick ink in one of the mirrors, the frat boy excitedly bounced up to Sloane's counter to pay off the hard work. ""Thanks, it looks great!"" he said simply before skipping out the door, a couple business cards in his saggy pockets.
The rest of her day would be a slow one, and her shoulders sank as she thought--she didn't want to think. Even as she sipped her tea, brewed specifically to help her relax, she grew tense. So, after double checking her appointment book, Sloane closed up shop for the day, bundled up, and stepped outside to do something. Maybe make up for missing her morning workout. </s>"

Little talons digging into the ground Sky watched as Grimbold killed the swan. It was almost serial. This was supposed to be some kind of lesson? It could be that it was something about death and how life is precious, but even then, it was a gruesome way to teach it. Honestly she didn't know how to react to it. Sky knew these lessons were for a lesson, she's been with Grimbold and the others for years now. It just wasn't something she was expecting that night.
""Sir you have to calm down please. Everything is alright, nothing you're seeing is real. You're in a safe place."" Sky said softly to a young man that was suffering from the after effects of a cocaine addiction. He was hallucinating right now and there wasn't really much she could currently do.
There was a wall blocking her from Interacting with him as his case of hallucination [/INST] s tended to be violent. He tried to choke one of the nurses when he came in yesterday. As her job here was to be a counselor she wasn't aloud to interact with any kind of medication. She's learned though that certain words can benefit someone. The power she held could sometimes help, not that she liked using it.
""Sky I think we're going to have to wait a while more until the hallucinations stop. It's probably best if you talk to other patients for now."" A nurse told her and Sky nodded walking back to her office in defeat.
Sitting down in her desk chair she sighed exhuasted. The only thing about this job is that she could always be called in. It just happened her work day started at 4am when she'd gotten home at 2am. At this rate she'd be cut soon and get to go home for the day.

Interacting With; Nate Hardwicke 
Fair to say, Angel's first experience with the ""lesson"" Grimbold had arranged for the group, wasn't a particularly pleasant one. Before this, she hadn't really considered the potential darkness she was messing with. Sure, a cool little power and shape-shifting seemed like awesome tricks, that weren't large or powerful enough to be something as anxiety-inducing and world-shaking as something like Magneto's powers in X-Men. Because of this, Angel had never figured there'd be a price - unless it was the small tasks that Grimbold asked of them. Like her first task, an innocent - and hella ironic - Pentagram on a church. Then it was ruin someone's weekend, and considering her target, would be simply dealing out some wicked bad karma on the guy.
But sacrificing something as pure and innocent as a swan?
Shit, Angel was hardly the first in line to sign up for PETA - she loved her meat too much. Damn, if somebody offered her a swan steak she'd try it. But what Grimbold did was just disturbing... along with what occurred afterwards.
Chills had gone down her back, as she and the others sat and watched in their animal forms. Suddenly, being a Coyote didn't feel so cool. It felt even less cool as this black stuff began emanating from the swan's lifeless body. A whine pitched in her throat almost subconsciously, thinking back to the Game of Thrones jokes she and Cara had been throwing around earlier.
""Didn't realize Grimbold had contacts with Melisandre and the shadow-baby army."" She thought to herself weakly - trying to grasp at some form of humour to relax the situation. But alas, she could not share this quip, and she simply watched on uncomfortably until Grimbold dismissed them.
Fair to say, she'd found it hard to find sleep immediately that night - nothing a few drops of rum didn't cure, but still - she didn't like the fact that something their supposed Mentor had done was giving her second thoughts about sleeping.

""Nate, so help me GOD, if you don't turn off that music I'll burn your goddamn dick off in your sleep."" Was Angel's second sentence of the morning. The first had been a similar threat, unheard by Nate, followed by a large string of muttered expletives.
What had brought on this particular threat to her charming younger brother, had been Daft Punk. Robot Rock, to be specific. Now, Angel didn't have a problem with Daft Punk - enjoyed them, in fact.
But not at 7AM, using the sounds system cranked high.
On her one weekday without [/INST] class.
Not even bothering to get out of her bed, Angel had simply phoned her brother, and hung up once the threat was carried across. The music stopped.
Sadly, Angel's ire had been tickled enough to keep her awake, and she came to the unfortunate conclusion that her full bladder and empty stomach had now overtaken rule in her body, making sleep impossible at this point.
Waiting for her Gremlin of a brother to leave for High School, Angel commandeered the bathroom, putting on her own playlist as she showered. The soothing yet upbeat tunes of Clean Bandit were more than enough to relax her, paired with the warm water pounding away on her shoulders, and her orange scented shampoo and body wash. Angel was surprised to find herself so grimy - it's not like she had been rolling around in the dirt last night.
""Well... unless you count the falling over on the way back to the cabin."" Chuckling to herself at the memory, she was relieved to find that the recollection of last night wasn't as haunting as she had thought before going to sleep. Still freaked out slightly by the whole ""chanting and sacrificing"" stunt Grimbold had pulled, but in the light of day, it seemed less disturbing.
It didn't take long for Angel to dry her hair and get dressed - and then feel somewhat bored. It seemed the right side of her brain was still snoozing away upstairs in her bedroom, as she felt no desire to draw or bust out some tunes on her guitar.
Which left food. And what better food could one ingest than bacon?
""Of course... no pig. Nice one, Uncle James."" Pulling a face and turning away from the sadly swine-deprived fridge, Angel noticed her brother's wallet on the dining table, along with his half-empty cereal bowl.
""Jesus Nate; what am I, your housekeeper?"" She muttered with a scowl, dumping his slowly congealing flakes in the bin before looking back at his wallet - which he had forgotten. Again.
Picking it up, a wicked smile appeared on Angel's face as she pulled out $20. ""Ah, sweet, sweet revenge. Boy should know that I have a fee for cleaning up his shit."" Chuckling to herself as she stuffed the bill in her pocket, Angel grabbed her keys as she headed for the door. Little brother was treating her to breakfast at the cafe...

Upon arriving, Angel had taken up her favourite seat after ordering a bacon sandwich and chocolate milkshake from the counter - a little booth tucked away in the corner. Now, one could consider combining milk, chocolate and bacon to be an abomination, but for her, it was a perfectly balanced breakfast. </s>"

The Shrine reminded Cara of Stonehenge back home. The careful placement of the boulders in an almost perfect circle around the alter still awed Cara, even if she had seen the exact same rocks almost twelve times within the year she'd met the critters. She carefully untangled her body away from Angel's neck, sliding down her body towards the ground.
And boy was she glad that she wasn't still hanging off the newbie's neck. If Grimbold's chanting wasn't creepy enough, he was holding a dagger in the direction of the swan, who was still laying by the alter helplessly. The sudden strike from Grimbold's dagger would've caused Cara to constrict around Angel's neck instinctively, but instead it looked like she was almost curling into her body as her black pupils stared at the scene ahead.
""---ne?""
This whole situation reminded Cara of a cult sacrifice - one you see in many weird films and horror flicks. It was definitely a first, to see Grimbold killing a woodland critter and watching black smoke ooze from the body like blood from a wound.
""---sborne?""
What was even weirder was that Grimbold dismissed everybody straight after; leading them back to his cabin to allow the others, including Cara, to return back to their home. Cara didn't have the heart to say anything as she ducked out of the cabin after changing. She just gave a small nod in the direction of the elder man, her mind still processing the previous events carefully.
""Miss Osborne!""
The voice came from right beside Cara, the girl almost jolting out of her skin in response. She turned to the right, eyes widened and heart racing as her Professor stared at her with a disappointed look on his face. ""S-sorry 'bout that."" Cara apologised, looking away to stare down at her empty page that was supposed to be filled with notes. 'Crap, that's an hour wasted. Good job, Cara.'
The Professor turned to the front of the hall once more, returning to his teachings of the nervous system as Cara mentally berated herself. As he answered more questions, Cara realised tha [/INST] t she was given a golden opportunity. Discreetly turning her head to the left, as if she were tilting her head to stare at the wall, she peered over her shoulder at the blonde head behind her, working hard like a good student. Cara could use the opportunity to talk to her target, get to know her enough to be able to figure out what scared the girl and use it against her.
Maybe things weren't too bad after all.

With the seminar over with, Cara immediately jumped out of her seat, spotting Janet already packing up hurriedly. Cara couldn't help but notice how shaky and jittery the girl was, storing the information in her mind as her mouth curled into the familiar sweet smile. Cara approached the blonde, eyes sparkling and a charming grin on her face as she clutched her notepad against her body. 'Gotta lay it on thick.'
""Hi~!"" She greeted in a sing-song voice. Cara's mouth twitched as Janet didn't even bother to look up at her, instead busy with shoving her pen in her already filled pencil case. ""I guess you already know why I'm here so um, could I maybe borrow some of your notes you took today?"" I mean, you're the smartest one here, and if there's anyone I can trust to take good notes, it's you-"" Cara was cut short by a cold glare.
""Save it, I need to get out of here.""
Blinking twice, Cara barely managed to keep her façade from slipping as she continued, even tilting her head to the side to feign obliviousness. ""Pardon? I- I was just hoping you could help me out-""
Once again, Cara was cut short by Janet, who finally slipped her bag over her shoulder, ""ask someone else. I have... somewhere I need to be."" One more look out the window, Janet brushed past the shorter girl and out towards the exit, leaving Cara's fake smile to immediately wash from her face. Instead of feeling angry, like she would've been after being brushed off like she was nothing, Cara couldn't help but grin to herself. After peering out of the window to find nothing but trees, Cara pulled out her phone, selecting the contact she needed before typing.

Father Lynch emerged from the front doors of the church. He had just finished his letter and was now heading to the mailbox to post it. He enjoyed the morning hours when there still shone some sunlight on this otherwise so grim town. It was not only the eternal shadow of the mountain that they lived under. It was also in the atmosphere. Though many people where christians, it was as if the heathen spirits that dwelled here eons ago, never really left this place. As servant of the lord, he could sense these things. But with the awareness also came the responsibility. It was his holy duty, to rid this town once and for all, from the shadow that was cast, by evil spirits of the past. With the light of the lord, he would clense this place and it's people.
The last mayor had considered his ideas lunatic. But now with the new mayor, he was going to take it on all differently. He had his plans all worked out. And once he would get the chance to talk to her, he would make her see the things for how they were. With her help [/INST] , he would finally be able to fullfill this dream that he had since he was appointed this church in this town, ten years ago.
For he, Father Lynch, was the shepherd of these people -these sheep, that needed guidance. And protection from the ever pressing presence of the wolf. The Darkness that these ungratefull inhabitants were so unaware of.
There was actual lore on this. Ancient tales, that many discarded as child's stories. some parts of the town were older than most people knew. The Library had very old books. The church was build on ruins of a mysterious building that he still didn't know the purpose for. And the mines had been abandoned for longer than anyone's grandparents remembered.
And HE knew. HE was going to figure out why. HE saw the hidden patterns in what people might call bad luck. HE was going to end this. HE, not the Lord.. but Father Lynch.
But ofcourse he was going to need some help.
When the letter slipped into the mailbox, father lynch snapped out of his daydream, before starting his way back to the church. </s>"

Sloane drew in a long, deep breath. The cold air sent a chill up her spine, but filled her with a new, fresh energy as she looked at the town.

Tobias knew that their powers were the result of the occult, the arcane, as turning into an animal and having supernatural powers clearly was not the norm. Yes, last night's events should have been expected, but it seemed so surreal. Grimbold sacrificed a swan to someone.. or something. He tried not to dwell on the thought, but hell, this was the stuff of horror novels and movies. What could possibly be what he assumed was Grimbold's master? A bloodthirsty god? Unholy specters? Tobias hated to admit it, but he was a bit fearful of the truth.
Not that he was going to tell anyone anyway. If there was one thing he didn't need, it was Sloane finding out and giving him more shit than usual. Just the thought of it made Tobias cringe. The group was fine and all for small talk, but Tobias doubted giving the group personal information was the best idea. Tobias didn't quite trust any of them with anything significant either.
Damn, even when he was in that gang there wasn't much to worry about. Sure, there was the whole gang rivalry thing and cops beating you to a pulp trying to ""arrest"" you, but if you followed orders you'd be fine. The gang would have your back. Usually. That might also be the case with Grimbold as well, but when you added in black magic, Tobias wasn't so sure anymore. Perhaps if he crossed Grimbold one day, Tobias would be the one on the altar, being sacrificed up to whatever. But it was late and he needed the rest, so Tobias tried to dispel the thoughts from his mind and at least try and get some sleep.

He ended up getting very little sleep, his thoughts from last n [/INST] ight preventing any sort of restful sleep. Tobias was used to it, as he woke up as early as 4 am to get to work, but the first few minutes of trying to get up was always a personal battle. Eventually, after using up every single drop of willpower, Tobias dragged himself out of the bed and then to the fridge, where he would whip up a breakfast of...
Nothing. Looks like Tobias would need to use his day off to hit the market to replenish his barren fridge. But first, he was going to get some breakfast at the Café. Luckily for his sleep and food deprived body, it wasn't much of a walk to reach the entrance. Quickly looking at his own reflection in the glass door, he made sure his hair was at least somewhat presentable.
Tobias eventually ordered some breakfast pastries and a cup of OJ. Tobias didn't really like Caffeine, and despite what anyone else said about it, he was pretty sure coffee was some sort of liquid narcotic. Why else would someone spend dozens of dollars buying that crap?
He had gotten his order, however; Tobias found his favorite spot taken. Well, not exactly taken, just that the table half occupied. Shame really, it was the only spot that you could eat your breakfast in some relative silence. But Tobias soon realized the person that had taken his spot was Angel, the newbie, so he took the opposite seat across from her. Looking at her breakfast, Tobias was no longer sure what invoked more fear into him, last night's events, or Angel's food choices. He opened his mouth, intending to make a remark on her diet, but in the end decided against it and decided to just greet her normally.

It was a pretty popular meeting spot after all. However Teryn, like himself, didn't seem the type to go out of her way to interact with people unless it was necessary. Shaking himself from his reverie, Daniel quickly muttered, ""Morning,"" as he straightened himself up from the display case. Before he could think of something to say, Teryn spoke up again. ""When is your break?"" Daniel dusted his hands off on his apron as he glanced towards the clock on the wall. She must really need help with something. Daniel highly doubted she merely wanted to hang out. ""Umm, in about half an hour. If you want to just hang around, I can come find you when I'm done."" Daniel offered her what he hope [/INST] d was a friendly smile. In reality, he was actually pretty anxious to hear her reason for seeking him out. But in hindsight, she was probably more anxious than he felt since she willingly came to a crowded place just to talk to him. At that moment he heard someone calling her name over the buzz of conversation. ""I think your order is ready. I won't be long.""
Daniel decided to take his break a little early since he did arrive earlier than normal that morning. Hanging up his apron in the back and grabbing his jacket from his locker, Daniel made his way back up front where he found Teryn sitting near the back of the Cafe. He also noticed Angel and Tobias must have arrived not too long ago because Angel seemed to be tucking into her meal with enthusiasm. He nodded a quick greeting in their direction, not knowing if they really noticed or cared, and continued towards Teryn's table. Taking a seat across from her, Daniel offered a small smile.

Angel had been gazing out of the window, lazily stirring her milkshake with her straw when Tobias sat opposite her. She was slightly surprised - what little she knew of Toby was that he generally kept to himself. Not that she minded he'd sat down - she offered up a smile in welcome. Toby looked like he could use some company anyhow - he looked more tired than she felt.
""Yeah, I usually take my drinks to go. But my brother kindly woke me up on my morning off, so here I am."" She explained, taking a bite of her sandwich as her mind drifted back to the last time she'd seen Toby - the night before.
Swallowing her mouthful, and return the nod with a smile as Daniel passed their table, Angel paused somewhat hesitantly before continuing to s [/INST] peak.
""So, that was really... something last night. Have to say, I wasn't expecting some druid-type shit to go down. Well... I wasn't sure what to expect actually.""

Tobias found himself doubting whether he should really follow through on the task Grimbold gave him, but at this point it was too late to just turn around and pretend nothing happened.

While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door-
Only this, and nothing more."" 
That was as far as Robert got into Poe's poem. With not much people in the library, he had some time to read away. Not that he was allowed to do that, but hey, Martha couldn't watch him everywhere. This guy was a classic and when Rob saw 'the raven' in the index, he was planning on dreaming away and making unnecessary links to Terry.
But this was only the first verse, and the complete poem's length was too long for his attention span. It wasn't all that catchy. Metrum, seriously. How was he supposed to fit in:""Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore"" if he was going to read that out loud.
